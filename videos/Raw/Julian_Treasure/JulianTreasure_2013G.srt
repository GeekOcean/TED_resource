1
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:15,866
The human voice:

2
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:17,454
It's the instrument we all play.

3
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:20,889
It's the most powerful sound in the world, probably.

4
00:00:20,913 --> 00:00:23,736
It's the only one that can start a war or say "I love you."

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,618
And yet many people have the experience

6
00:00:25,642 --> 00:00:28,006
that when they speak, people don't listen to them.

7
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:29,142
And why is that?

8
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:32,932
How can we speak powerfully to make change in the world?

9
00:00:33,305 --> 00:00:34,617
What I'd like to suggest,

10
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:37,486
there are a number of habits that we need to move away from.

11
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,240
I've assembled for your pleasure here seven deadly sins of speaking.

12
00:00:41,264 --> 00:00:43,672
I'm not pretending this is an exhaustive list,

13
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:48,928
but these seven, I think, are pretty large habits that we can all fall into.

14
00:00:48,952 --> 00:00:50,959
First, gossip.

15
00:00:51,809 --> 00:00:53,917
Speaking ill of somebody who's not present.

16
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:56,616
Not a nice habit, and we know perfectly well

17
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,520
the person gossiping, five minutes later, will be gossiping about us.

18
00:01:01,591 --> 00:01:03,311
Second, judging.

19
00:01:03,335 --> 00:01:05,719
We know people who are like this in conversation,

20
00:01:05,743 --> 00:01:07,675
and it's very hard to listen to somebody

21
00:01:07,699 --> 00:01:11,825
if you know that you're being judged and found wanting at the same time.

22
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:13,725
Third, negativity.

23
00:01:14,267 --> 00:01:15,555
You can fall into this.

24
00:01:15,579 --> 00:01:18,616
My mother, in the last years of her life, became very negative,

25
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,962
and it's hard to listen.

26
00:01:19,986 --> 00:01:22,719
I remember one day, I said to her, "It's October 1 today,"

27
00:01:22,743 --> 00:01:24,836
and she said, "I know, isn't it dreadful?"

28
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,058
(Laughter)

29
00:01:27,082 --> 00:01:29,431
It's hard to listen when somebody's that negative.

30
00:01:29,455 --> 00:01:30,727
(Laughter)

31
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:33,271
And another form of negativity, complaining.

32
00:01:33,295 --> 00:01:37,338
Well, this is the national art of the U.K.

33
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:38,773
It's our national sport.

34
00:01:38,797 --> 00:01:42,231
We complain about the weather, sport, about politics, about everything,

35
00:01:42,255 --> 00:01:44,351
but actually, complaining is viral misery.

36
00:01:44,375 --> 00:01:47,007
It's not spreading sunshine and lightness in the world.

37
00:01:48,112 --> 00:01:49,844
Excuses.

38
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,192
We've all met this guy.

39
00:01:51,216 --> 00:01:52,792
Maybe we've all been this guy.

40
00:01:52,816 --> 00:01:55,286
Some people have a blamethrower.

41
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,514
They just pass it on to everybody else

42
00:01:57,538 --> 00:01:59,842
and don't take responsibility for their actions,

43
00:01:59,866 --> 00:02:02,778
and again, hard to listen to somebody who is being like that.

44
00:02:02,802 --> 00:02:04,600
Penultimate, the sixth of the seven,

45
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:08,006
embroidery, exaggeration.

46
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:10,434
It demeans our language, actually, sometimes.

47
00:02:10,458 --> 00:02:13,726
For example, if I see something that really is awesome,

48
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,016
what do I call it?

49
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,636
(Laughter)

50
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:21,096
And then, of course, this exaggeration becomes lying,

51
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,119
and we don't want to listen to people we know are lying to us.

52
00:02:24,143 --> 00:02:26,383
And finally, dogmatism.

53
00:02:27,508 --> 00:02:31,119
The confusion of facts with opinions.

54
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:33,058
When those two things get conflated,

55
00:02:33,082 --> 00:02:34,559
you're listening into the wind.

56
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:38,250
You know, somebody is bombarding you with their opinions as if they were true.

57
00:02:38,274 --> 00:02:40,343
It's difficult to listen to that.

58
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:43,384
So here they are, seven deadly sins of speaking.

59
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:45,817
These are things I think we need to avoid.

60
00:02:45,841 --> 00:02:48,686
But is there a positive way to think about this?

61
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:49,969
Yes, there is.

62
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:55,770
I'd like to suggest that there are four really powerful cornerstones, foundations,

63
00:02:55,794 --> 00:02:58,216
that we can stand on if we want our speech

64
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,451
to be powerful and to make change in the world.

65
00:03:02,108 --> 00:03:04,319
Fortunately, these things spell a word.

66
00:03:04,343 --> 00:03:07,415
The word is "hail," and it has a great definition as well.

67
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:10,083
I'm not talking about the stuff that falls from the sky

68
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,371
and hits you on the head.

69
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:13,015
I'm talking about this definition,

70
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:14,836
to greet or acclaim enthusiastically,

71
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,103
which is how I think our words will be received

72
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:18,699
if we stand on these four things.

73
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:20,221
So what do they stand for?

74
00:03:20,245 --> 00:03:21,621
See if you can guess.

75
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:25,079
The H, honesty, of course,

76
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:28,050
being true in what you say, being straight and clear.

77
00:03:28,074 --> 00:03:32,091
The A is authenticity, just being yourself.

78
00:03:32,115 --> 00:03:35,301
A friend of mine described it as standing in your own truth,

79
00:03:35,325 --> 00:03:37,239
which I think is a lovely way to put it.

80
00:03:37,263 --> 00:03:39,875
The I is integrity, being your word,

81
00:03:39,899 --> 00:03:41,663
actually doing what you say,

82
00:03:41,687 --> 00:03:43,517
and being somebody people can trust.

83
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:46,175
And the L is love.

84
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:49,047
I don't mean romantic love,

85
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:52,456
but I do mean wishing people well, for two reasons.

86
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,870
First of all, I think absolute honesty may not be what we want.

87
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:58,459
I mean, my goodness, you look ugly this morning.

88
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:01,817
Perhaps that's not necessary.

89
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,175
Tempered with love, of course, honesty is a great thing.

90
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:08,270
But also, if you're really wishing somebody well,

91
00:04:08,294 --> 00:04:10,907
it's very hard to judge them at the same time.

92
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:14,493
I'm not even sure you can do those two things simultaneously.

93
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:16,706
So hail.

94
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:18,463
Also, now that's what you say,

95
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:20,731
and it's like the old song, it is what you say,

96
00:04:20,755 --> 00:04:22,434
it's also the way that you say it.

97
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,206
You have an amazing toolbox.

98
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:26,066
This instrument is incredible,

99
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,606
and yet this is a toolbox that very few people have ever opened.

100
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:32,227
I'd like to have a little rummage in there with you now

101
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,651
and just pull a few tools out

102
00:04:33,675 --> 00:04:35,914
that you might like to take away and play with,

103
00:04:35,938 --> 00:04:38,238
which will increase the power of your speaking.

104
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:39,782
Register, for example.

105
00:04:39,806 --> 00:04:43,976
Now, falsetto register may not be very useful most of the time,

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,030
but there's a register in between.

107
00:04:46,054 --> 00:04:48,215
I'm not going to get very technical about this

108
00:04:48,239 --> 00:04:50,001
for any of you who are voice coaches.

109
00:04:50,025 --> 00:04:51,738
You can locate your voice, however.

110
00:04:51,762 --> 00:04:54,620
So if I talk up here in my nose, you can hear the difference.

111
00:04:54,644 --> 00:04:56,128
If I go down here in my throat,

112
00:04:56,152 --> 00:04:58,781
which is where most of us speak from most of the time.

113
00:04:58,805 --> 00:05:00,438
But if you want weight,

114
00:05:00,462 --> 00:05:02,916
you need to go down here to the chest.

115
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,526
You hear the difference?

116
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,566
We vote for politicians with lower voices, it's true,

117
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:11,534
because we associate depth with power

118
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:13,320
and with authority.

119
00:05:14,265 --> 00:05:15,632
That's register.

120
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:17,297
Then we have timbre.

121
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:19,066
It's the way your voice feels.

122
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,422
Again, the research shows

123
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:24,220
that we prefer voices which are rich, smooth, warm,

124
00:05:24,244 --> 00:05:25,730
like hot chocolate.

125
00:05:26,455 --> 00:05:29,719
Well if that's not you, that's not the end of the world,

126
00:05:29,743 --> 00:05:31,161
because you can train.

127
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:32,405
Go and get a voice coach.

128
00:05:32,429 --> 00:05:34,287
And there are amazing things you can do

129
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:36,717
with breathing, with posture, and with exercises

130
00:05:36,741 --> 00:05:39,231
to improve the timbre of your voice.

131
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:41,023
Then prosody. I love prosody.

132
00:05:41,047 --> 00:05:43,199
This is the sing-song, the meta-language

133
00:05:43,223 --> 00:05:45,273
that we use in order to impart meaning.

134
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:48,111
It's root one for meaning in conversation.

135
00:05:48,135 --> 00:05:52,191
People who speak all on one note are really quite hard to listen to

136
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:54,407
if they don't have any prosody at all.

137
00:05:54,431 --> 00:05:57,382
That's where the word "monotonic" comes from,

138
00:05:57,406 --> 00:05:59,343
or monotonous, monotone.

139
00:06:00,126 --> 00:06:03,399
Also, we have repetitive prosody now coming in,

140
00:06:03,423 --> 00:06:06,119
where every sentence ends as if it were a question

141
00:06:06,143 --> 00:06:08,620
when it's actually not a question, it's a statement?

142
00:06:08,644 --> 00:06:10,950
(Laughter)

143
00:06:10,974 --> 00:06:12,536
And if you repeat that one,

144
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,904
it's actually restricting your ability to communicate through prosody,

145
00:06:15,928 --> 00:06:17,790
which I think is a shame,

146
00:06:17,814 --> 00:06:19,799
so let's try and break that habit.

147
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:22,214
Pace.

148
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:24,999
I can get very excited by saying something really quickly,

149
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,375
or I can slow right down to emphasize,

150
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:32,015
and at the end of that, of course, is our old friend silence.

151
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:37,515
There's nothing wrong with a bit of silence in a talk, is there?

152
00:06:38,381 --> 00:06:40,820
We don't have to fill it with ums and ahs.

153
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:42,883
It can be very powerful.

154
00:06:43,643 --> 00:06:45,947
Of course, pitch often goes along with pace

155
00:06:45,971 --> 00:06:48,591
to indicate arousal, but you can do it just with pitch.

156
00:06:48,615 --> 00:06:50,179
Where did you leave my keys?

157
00:06:50,203 --> 00:06:52,283
(Higher pitch) Where did you leave my keys?

158
00:06:52,307 --> 00:06:55,952
So, slightly different meaning in those two deliveries.

159
00:06:55,976 --> 00:06:58,198
And finally, volume.

160
00:06:58,222 --> 00:07:01,599
(Loud) I can get really excited by using volume.

161
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:03,776
Sorry about that, if I startled anybody.

162
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,323
Or, I can have you really pay attention by getting very quiet.

163
00:07:08,527 --> 00:07:10,323
Some people broadcast the whole time.

164
00:07:10,347 --> 00:07:11,696
Try not to do that.

165
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,548
That's called sodcasting,

166
00:07:13,572 --> 00:07:15,241
(Laughter)

167
00:07:15,265 --> 00:07:19,809
Imposing your sound on people around you carelessly and inconsiderately.

168
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:20,911
Not nice.

169
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:23,467
Of course, where this all comes into play most of all

170
00:07:23,491 --> 00:07:25,995
is when you've got something really important to do.

171
00:07:26,019 --> 00:07:29,447
It might be standing on a stage like this and giving a talk to people.

172
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:31,335
It might be proposing marriage,

173
00:07:31,359 --> 00:07:34,489
asking for a raise, a wedding speech.

174
00:07:34,513 --> 00:07:36,495
Whatever it is, if it's really important,

175
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:40,268
you owe it to yourself to look at this toolbox

176
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:42,305
and the engine that it's going to work on,

177
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:45,400
and no engine works well without being warmed up.

178
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:46,893
Warm up your voice.

179
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:49,353
Actually, let me show you how to do that.

180
00:07:49,377 --> 00:07:52,332
Would you all like to stand up for a moment?

181
00:07:52,356 --> 00:07:53,487
I'm going to show you

182
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:58,721
the six vocal warm-up exercises that I do before every talk I ever do.

183
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,655
Any time you're going to talk to anybody important, do these.

184
00:08:01,679 --> 00:08:04,458
First, arms up, deep breath in,

185
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:07,560
and sigh out, ahhhhh, like that.

186
00:08:07,584 --> 00:08:09,188
One more time.

187
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:12,186
Ahhhh, very good.

188
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:13,928
Now we're going to warm up our lips,

189
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,280
and we're going to go Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba,

190
00:08:16,304 --> 00:08:19,232
Ba, Ba, Ba, Ba. Very good.

191
00:08:19,256 --> 00:08:22,672
And now, brrrrrrrrrr,

192
00:08:22,696 --> 00:08:24,222
just like when you were a kid.

193
00:08:24,246 --> 00:08:26,649
Brrrr. Now your lips should be coming alive.

194
00:08:26,673 --> 00:08:28,324
We're going to do the tongue next

195
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:32,646
with exaggerated la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la.

196
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:34,861
Beautiful. You're getting really good at this.

197
00:08:34,885 --> 00:08:37,751
And then, roll an R. Rrrrrrr.

198
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:39,967
That's like champagne for the tongue.

199
00:08:39,991 --> 00:08:42,287
Finally, and if I can only do one,

200
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,094
the pros call this the siren.

201
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:46,738
It's really good. It starts with "we" and goes to "aw."

202
00:08:46,762 --> 00:08:48,382
The "we" is high, the "aw" is low.

203
00:08:48,406 --> 00:08:54,502
So you go, weeeaawww, weeeaawww.

204
00:08:54,526 --> 00:08:56,765
Fantastic. Give yourselves a round of applause.

205
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:58,034
Take a seat, thank you.

206
00:08:58,058 --> 00:08:59,508
(Applause)

207
00:08:59,532 --> 00:09:02,132
Next time you speak, do those in advance.

208
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:04,772
Now let me just put this in context to close.

209
00:09:04,796 --> 00:09:07,068
This is a serious point here.

210
00:09:07,092 --> 00:09:08,899
This is where we are now, right?

211
00:09:08,923 --> 00:09:10,564
We speak not very well

212
00:09:10,588 --> 00:09:12,432
to people who simply aren't listening

213
00:09:12,456 --> 00:09:15,351
in an environment that's all about noise and bad acoustics.

214
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:18,594
I have talked about that on this stage in different phases.

215
00:09:18,618 --> 00:09:20,228
What would the world be like

216
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:21,948
if we were speaking powerfully

217
00:09:21,972 --> 00:09:24,004
to people who were listening consciously

218
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:27,398
in environments which were actually fit for purpose?

219
00:09:27,422 --> 00:09:30,381
Or to make that a bit larger,

220
00:09:30,405 --> 00:09:31,739
what would the world be like

221
00:09:31,763 --> 00:09:34,106
if we were creating sound consciously

222
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,139
and consuming sound consciously

223
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:37,866
and designing all our environments

224
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:39,343
consciously for sound?

225
00:09:39,367 --> 00:09:42,467
That would be a world that does sound beautiful,

226
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:46,378
and one where understanding would be the norm,

227
00:09:46,402 --> 00:09:49,051
and that is an idea worth spreading.

228
00:09:49,075 --> 00:09:50,207
Thank you.

229
00:09:50,231 --> 00:09:51,753
(Applause)
