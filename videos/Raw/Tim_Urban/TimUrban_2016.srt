1
00:00:12,465 --> 00:00:13,835
So in college,

2
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:16,733
I was a government major,

3
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:19,219
which means I had to write a lot of papers.

4
00:00:19,243 --> 00:00:21,291
Now, when a normal student writes a paper,

5
00:00:21,315 --> 00:00:23,688
they might spread the work out a little like this.

6
00:00:23,712 --> 00:00:24,863
So, you know --

7
00:00:24,887 --> 00:00:26,544
(Laughter)

8
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:28,395
you get started maybe a little slowly,

9
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:30,387
but you get enough done in the first week

10
00:00:30,411 --> 00:00:32,242
that, with some heavier days later on,

11
00:00:32,266 --> 00:00:34,423
everything gets done, things stay civil.

12
00:00:34,447 --> 00:00:35,649
(Laughter)

13
00:00:35,673 --> 00:00:37,944
And I would want to do that like that.

14
00:00:37,968 --> 00:00:39,162
That would be the plan.

15
00:00:39,186 --> 00:00:41,676
I would have it all ready to go,

16
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,194
but then, actually, the paper would come along,

17
00:00:44,218 --> 00:00:46,159
and then I would kind of do this.

18
00:00:46,183 --> 00:00:48,553
(Laughter)

19
00:00:48,577 --> 00:00:50,720
And that would happen every single paper.

20
00:00:51,458 --> 00:00:55,340
But then came my 90-page senior thesis,

21
00:00:55,364 --> 00:00:57,651
a paper you're supposed to spend a year on.

22
00:00:57,675 --> 00:01:01,294
And I knew for a paper like that, my normal work flow was not an option.

23
00:01:01,318 --> 00:01:02,719
It was way too big a project.

24
00:01:02,743 --> 00:01:03,896
So I planned things out,

25
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,125
and I decided I kind of had to go something like this.

26
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:09,053
This is how the year would go.

27
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:11,044
So I'd start off light,

28
00:01:11,068 --> 00:01:13,386
and I'd bump it up in the middle months,

29
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:16,036
and then at the end, I would kick it up into high gear

30
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:17,499
just like a little staircase.

31
00:01:17,523 --> 00:01:19,585
How hard could it be to walk up the stairs?

32
00:01:20,053 --> 00:01:21,372
No big deal, right?

33
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:24,720
But then, the funniest thing happened.

34
00:01:24,744 --> 00:01:26,055
Those first few months?

35
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:27,778
They came and went,

36
00:01:27,802 --> 00:01:29,387
and I couldn't quite do stuff.

37
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:31,260
So we had an awesome new revised plan.

38
00:01:31,284 --> 00:01:32,451
(Laughter)

39
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:33,634
And then --

40
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:35,540
(Laughter)

41
00:01:35,564 --> 00:01:38,348
But then those middle months actually went by,

42
00:01:38,372 --> 00:01:40,554
and I didn't really write words,

43
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:42,413
and so we were here.

44
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,896
And then two months turned into one month,

45
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,545
which turned into two weeks.

46
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:48,878
And one day I woke up

47
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:52,163
with three days until the deadline,

48
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:55,253
still not having written a word,

49
00:01:55,277 --> 00:01:57,336
and so I did the only thing I could:

50
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,967
I wrote 90 pages over 72 hours,

51
00:01:59,991 --> 00:02:02,267
pulling not one but two all-nighters --

52
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:04,860
humans are not supposed to pull two all-nighters --

53
00:02:06,193 --> 00:02:08,186
sprinted across campus,

54
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,696
dove in slow motion,

55
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,776
and got it in just at the deadline.

56
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,824
I thought that was the end of everything.

57
00:02:13,848 --> 00:02:15,407
But a week later I get a call,

58
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:16,917
and it's the school.

59
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:19,216
And they say, "Is this Tim Urban?"

60
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:20,708
And I say, "Yeah."

61
00:02:20,732 --> 00:02:23,072
And they say, "We need to talk about your thesis."

62
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:24,351
And I say, "OK."

63
00:02:25,288 --> 00:02:26,510
And they say,

64
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,946
"It's the best one we've ever seen."

65
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,675
(Laughter)

66
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:34,524
(Applause)

67
00:02:36,765 --> 00:02:38,067
That did not happen.

68
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,229
(Laughter)

69
00:02:40,253 --> 00:02:42,876
It was a very, very bad thesis.

70
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,174
(Laughter)

71
00:02:45,198 --> 00:02:49,298
I just wanted to enjoy that one moment when all of you thought,

72
00:02:49,322 --> 00:02:51,227
"This guy is amazing!"

73
00:02:51,251 --> 00:02:52,599
(Laughter)

74
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,290
No, no, it was very, very bad.

75
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:58,571
Anyway, today I'm a writer-blogger guy.

76
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:00,338
I write the blog Wait But Why.

77
00:03:00,362 --> 00:03:04,098
And a couple of years ago, I decided to write about procrastination.

78
00:03:04,122 --> 00:03:07,406
My behavior has always perplexed the non-procrastinators around me,

79
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:11,118
and I wanted to explain to the non-procrastinators of the world

80
00:03:11,142 --> 00:03:13,249
what goes on in the heads of procrastinators,

81
00:03:13,273 --> 00:03:14,713
and why we are the way we are.

82
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:15,893
Now, I had a hypothesis

83
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:18,772
that the brains of procrastinators were actually different

84
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:20,753
than the brains of other people.

85
00:03:21,518 --> 00:03:23,709
And to test this, I found an MRI lab

86
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:26,165
that actually let me scan both my brain

87
00:03:26,189 --> 00:03:28,844
and the brain of a proven non-procrastinator,

88
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:30,303
so I could compare them.

89
00:03:30,327 --> 00:03:32,528
I actually brought them here to show you today.

90
00:03:32,552 --> 00:03:36,089
I want you to take a look carefully to see if you can notice a difference.

91
00:03:36,113 --> 00:03:38,427
I know that if you're not a trained brain expert,

92
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:40,714
it's not that obvious, but just take a look, OK?

93
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:42,866
So here's the brain of a non-procrastinator.

94
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,929
(Laughter)

95
00:03:45,953 --> 00:03:47,104
Now ...

96
00:03:48,145 --> 00:03:49,459
here's my brain.

97
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,826
(Laughter)

98
00:03:55,533 --> 00:03:57,097
There is a difference.

99
00:03:57,724 --> 00:04:00,112
Both brains have a Rational Decision-Maker in them,

100
00:04:00,136 --> 00:04:01,788
but the procrastinator's brain

101
00:04:01,812 --> 00:04:04,798
also has an Instant Gratification Monkey.

102
00:04:04,822 --> 00:04:07,124
Now, what does this mean for the procrastinator?

103
00:04:07,148 --> 00:04:09,589
Well, it means everything's fine until this happens.

104
00:04:09,613 --> 00:04:12,235
[This is a perfect time to get some work done.] [Nope!]

105
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:15,192
So the Rational Decision-Maker will make the rational decision

106
00:04:15,216 --> 00:04:17,112
to do something productive,

107
00:04:17,136 --> 00:04:19,086
but the Monkey doesn't like that plan,

108
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:20,618
so he actually takes the wheel,

109
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:23,523
and he says, "Actually, let's read the entire Wikipedia page

110
00:04:23,547 --> 00:04:25,683
of the Nancy Kerrigan/ Tonya Harding scandal,

111
00:04:25,707 --> 00:04:27,838
because I just remembered that that happened.

112
00:04:27,862 --> 00:04:28,878
(Laughter)

113
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:30,060
Then --

114
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:31,347
(Laughter)

115
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,409
Then we're going to go over to the fridge,

116
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:36,299
to see if there's anything new in there since 10 minutes ago.

117
00:04:36,323 --> 00:04:38,961
After that, we're going to go on a YouTube spiral

118
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:42,235
that starts with videos of Richard Feynman talking about magnets

119
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:44,975
and ends much, much later with us watching interviews

120
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:46,879
with Justin Bieber's mom.

121
00:04:46,903 --> 00:04:49,091
(Laughter)

122
00:04:49,115 --> 00:04:50,878
"All of that's going to take a while,

123
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:54,404
so we're not going to really have room on the schedule for any work today.

124
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,591
Sorry!"

125
00:04:55,615 --> 00:04:56,780
(Sigh)

126
00:04:58,145 --> 00:05:01,514
Now, what is going on here?

127
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:05,992
The Instant Gratification Monkey does not seem like a guy

128
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:07,270
you want behind the wheel.

129
00:05:07,294 --> 00:05:09,239
He lives entirely in the present moment.

130
00:05:09,263 --> 00:05:12,091
He has no memory of the past, no knowledge of the future,

131
00:05:12,115 --> 00:05:13,812
and he only cares about two things:

132
00:05:13,836 --> 00:05:15,519
easy and fun.

133
00:05:16,158 --> 00:05:19,250
Now, in the animal world, that works fine.

134
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:20,482
If you're a dog

135
00:05:20,506 --> 00:05:24,077
and you spend your whole life doing nothing other than easy and fun things,

136
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:25,266
you're a huge success!

137
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,201
(Laughter)

138
00:05:27,225 --> 00:05:28,511
And to the Monkey,

139
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:31,883
humans are just another animal species.

140
00:05:31,907 --> 00:05:36,413
You have to keep well-slept, well-fed and propagating into the next generation,

141
00:05:36,437 --> 00:05:38,723
which in tribal times might have worked OK.

142
00:05:38,747 --> 00:05:41,597
But, if you haven't noticed, now we're not in tribal times.

143
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:45,754
We're in an advanced civilization, and the Monkey does not know what that is.

144
00:05:45,778 --> 00:05:48,059
Which is why we have another guy in our brain,

145
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,448
the Rational Decision-Maker,

146
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:53,499
who gives us the ability to do things no other animal can do.

147
00:05:53,523 --> 00:05:55,444
We can visualize the future.

148
00:05:55,468 --> 00:05:57,220
We can see the big picture.

149
00:05:57,244 --> 00:05:58,594
We can make long-term plans.

150
00:05:58,618 --> 00:06:01,101
And he wants to take all of that into account.

151
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,649
And he wants to just have us do

152
00:06:03,673 --> 00:06:06,621
whatever makes sense to be doing right now.

153
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:08,034
Now, sometimes it makes sense

154
00:06:08,058 --> 00:06:10,087
to be doing things that are easy and fun,

155
00:06:10,111 --> 00:06:12,262
like when you're having dinner or going to bed

156
00:06:12,286 --> 00:06:14,114
or enjoying well-earned leisure time.

157
00:06:14,138 --> 00:06:15,588
That's why there's an overlap.

158
00:06:15,612 --> 00:06:17,356
Sometimes they agree.

159
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,202
But other times, it makes much more sense

160
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:23,828
to be doing things that are harder and less pleasant,

161
00:06:23,852 --> 00:06:25,392
for the sake of the big picture.

162
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:27,305
And that's when we have a conflict.

163
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:29,152
And for the procrastinator,

164
00:06:29,176 --> 00:06:31,685
that conflict tends to end a certain way every time,

165
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:35,429
leaving him spending a lot of time in this orange zone,

166
00:06:35,453 --> 00:06:39,780
an easy and fun place that's entirely out of the Makes Sense circle.

167
00:06:39,804 --> 00:06:42,083
I call it the Dark Playground.

168
00:06:42,107 --> 00:06:43,731
(Laughter)

169
00:06:43,755 --> 00:06:46,883
Now, the Dark Playground is a place

170
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,099
that all of you procrastinators out there know very well.

171
00:06:50,712 --> 00:06:52,516
It's where leisure activities happen

172
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,850
at times when leisure activities are not supposed to be happening.

173
00:06:56,238 --> 00:06:58,128
The fun you have in the Dark Playground

174
00:06:58,152 --> 00:07:00,635
isn't actually fun, because it's completely unearned,

175
00:07:00,659 --> 00:07:03,874
and the air is filled with guilt, dread, anxiety, self-hatred --

176
00:07:03,898 --> 00:07:06,016
all of those good procrastinator feelings.

177
00:07:06,523 --> 00:07:09,999
And the question is, in this situation, with the Monkey behind the wheel,

178
00:07:10,023 --> 00:07:13,616
how does the procrastinator ever get himself over here to this blue zone,

179
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,921
a less pleasant place, but where really important things happen?

180
00:07:16,945 --> 00:07:21,982
Well, turns out the procrastinator has a guardian angel,

181
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:25,214
someone who's always looking down on him and watching over him

182
00:07:25,238 --> 00:07:26,668
in his darkest moments --

183
00:07:26,692 --> 00:07:28,787
someone called the Panic Monster.

184
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:31,889
(Laughter)

185
00:07:34,206 --> 00:07:39,066
Now, the Panic Monster is dormant most of the time,

186
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:42,992
but he suddenly wakes up anytime a deadline gets too close

187
00:07:43,016 --> 00:07:45,061
or there's danger of public embarrassment,

188
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:47,596
a career disaster or some other scary consequence.

189
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,792
And importantly, he's the only thing the Monkey is terrified of.

190
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:56,394
Now, he became very relevant in my life pretty recently,

191
00:07:56,418 --> 00:07:59,664
because the people of TED reached out to me about six months ago

192
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:01,709
and invited me to do a TED Talk.

193
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,161
(Laughter)

194
00:08:06,878 --> 00:08:08,785
Now, of course, I said yes.

195
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:12,614
It's always been a dream of mine to have done a TED Talk in the past.

196
00:08:12,638 --> 00:08:16,610
(Laughter)

197
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:20,331
(Applause)

198
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:25,992
But in the middle of all this excitement,

199
00:08:26,016 --> 00:08:29,317
the Rational Decision-Maker seemed to have something else on his mind.

200
00:08:29,341 --> 00:08:31,889
He was saying, "Are we clear on what we just accepted?

201
00:08:31,913 --> 00:08:35,162
Do we get what's going to be now happening one day in the future?

202
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:37,453
We need to sit down and work on this right now."

203
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:40,742
And the Monkey said, "Totally agree, but let's just open Google Earth

204
00:08:40,766 --> 00:08:43,926
and zoom in to the bottom of India, like 200 feet above the ground,

205
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:47,571
and scroll up for two and a half hours til we get to the top of the country,

206
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,573
so we can get a better feel for India."

207
00:08:49,597 --> 00:08:54,032
(Laughter)

208
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,454
So that's what we did that day.

209
00:08:56,478 --> 00:08:59,148
(Laughter)

210
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:04,320
As six months turned into four and then two and then one,

211
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:07,439
the people of TED decided to release the speakers.

212
00:09:07,463 --> 00:09:10,075
And I opened up the website, and there was my face

213
00:09:10,099 --> 00:09:11,455
staring right back at me.

214
00:09:11,479 --> 00:09:13,079
And guess who woke up?

215
00:09:13,103 --> 00:09:16,218
(Laughter)

216
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,700
So the Panic Monster starts losing his mind,

217
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:22,470
and a few seconds later, the whole system's in mayhem.

218
00:09:22,494 --> 00:09:24,940
(Laughter)

219
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:30,432
And the Monkey -- remember, he's terrified of the Panic Monster --

220
00:09:30,456 --> 00:09:31,614
boom, he's up the tree!

221
00:09:31,638 --> 00:09:32,789
And finally,

222
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:35,409
finally, the Rational Decision-Maker can take the wheel

223
00:09:35,433 --> 00:09:37,151
and I can start working on the talk.

224
00:09:37,175 --> 00:09:39,463
Now, the Panic Monster explains

225
00:09:39,487 --> 00:09:42,968
all kinds of pretty insane procrastinator behavior,

226
00:09:42,992 --> 00:09:45,326
like how someone like me could spend two weeks

227
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,194
unable to start the opening sentence of a paper,

228
00:09:49,218 --> 00:09:51,989
and then miraculously find the unbelievable work ethic

229
00:09:52,013 --> 00:09:55,109
to stay up all night and write eight pages.

230
00:09:56,205 --> 00:09:59,187
And this entire situation, with the three characters --

231
00:09:59,211 --> 00:10:01,231
this is the procrastinator's system.

232
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,341
It's not pretty, but in the end, it works.

233
00:10:05,365 --> 00:10:09,427
This is what I decided to write about on the blog a couple of years ago.

234
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:12,422
When I did, I was amazed by the response.

235
00:10:12,446 --> 00:10:14,599
Literally thousands of emails came in,

236
00:10:14,623 --> 00:10:17,400
from all different kinds of people from all over the world,

237
00:10:17,424 --> 00:10:19,162
doing all different kinds of things.

238
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:22,152
These are people who were nurses, bankers, painters, engineers

239
00:10:22,176 --> 00:10:24,498
and lots and lots of PhD students.

240
00:10:24,522 --> 00:10:26,523
(Laughter)

241
00:10:26,547 --> 00:10:28,835
And they were all writing, saying the same thing:

242
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:30,811
"I have this problem too."

243
00:10:30,835 --> 00:10:34,664
But what struck me was the contrast between the light tone of the post

244
00:10:34,688 --> 00:10:36,783
and the heaviness of these emails.

245
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:39,890
These people were writing with intense frustration

246
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:42,676
about what procrastination had done to their lives,

247
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,730
about what this Monkey had done to them.

248
00:10:46,722 --> 00:10:49,688
And I thought about this, and I said,

249
00:10:49,712 --> 00:10:52,824
well, if the procrastinator's system works, then what's going on?

250
00:10:52,848 --> 00:10:55,334
Why are all of these people in such a dark place?

251
00:10:55,358 --> 00:10:58,656
Well, it turns out that there's two kinds of procrastination.

252
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:02,641
Everything I've talked about today, the examples I've given,

253
00:11:02,665 --> 00:11:03,816
they all have deadlines.

254
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,138
And when there's deadlines,

255
00:11:05,162 --> 00:11:08,087
the effects of procrastination are contained to the short term

256
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:10,024
because the Panic Monster gets involved.

257
00:11:10,048 --> 00:11:12,102
But there's a second kind of procrastination

258
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:14,613
that happens in situations when there is no deadline.

259
00:11:14,637 --> 00:11:17,327
So if you wanted a career where you're a self-starter --

260
00:11:17,351 --> 00:11:19,764
something in the arts, something entrepreneurial --

261
00:11:19,788 --> 00:11:23,313
there's no deadlines on those things at first, because nothing's happening,

262
00:11:23,337 --> 00:11:25,581
not until you've gone out and done the hard work

263
00:11:25,605 --> 00:11:27,231
to get momentum, get things going.

264
00:11:27,255 --> 00:11:30,333
There's also all kinds of important things outside of your career

265
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,962
that don't involve any deadlines,

266
00:11:31,986 --> 00:11:35,251
like seeing your family or exercising and taking care of your health,

267
00:11:35,275 --> 00:11:36,679
working on your relationship

268
00:11:36,703 --> 00:11:39,384
or getting out of a relationship that isn't working.

269
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:44,556
Now if the procrastinator's only mechanism of doing these hard things

270
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,465
is the Panic Monster, that's a problem,

271
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:49,289
because in all of these non-deadline situations,

272
00:11:49,313 --> 00:11:50,941
the Panic Monster doesn't show up.

273
00:11:50,965 --> 00:11:52,417
He has nothing to wake up for,

274
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:55,139
so the effects of procrastination, they're not contained;

275
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:56,903
they just extend outward forever.

276
00:11:57,773 --> 00:12:00,513
And it's this long-term kind of procrastination

277
00:12:00,537 --> 00:12:03,618
that's much less visible and much less talked about

278
00:12:03,642 --> 00:12:06,543
than the funnier, short-term deadline-based kind.

279
00:12:06,567 --> 00:12:09,670
It's usually suffered quietly and privately.

280
00:12:10,636 --> 00:12:11,790
And it can be the source

281
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:15,549
of a huge amount of long-term unhappiness, and regrets.

282
00:12:16,396 --> 00:12:19,268
And I thought, that's why those people are emailing,

283
00:12:19,292 --> 00:12:21,794
and that's why they're in such a bad place.

284
00:12:21,818 --> 00:12:24,562
It's not that they're cramming for some project.

285
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:28,007
It's that long-term procrastination has made them feel like a spectator,

286
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,070
at times, in their own lives.

287
00:12:30,414 --> 00:12:33,396
The frustration is not that they couldn't achieve their dreams;

288
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,509
it's that they weren't even able to start chasing them.

289
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:40,716
So I read these emails and I had a little bit of an epiphany --

290
00:12:42,002 --> 00:12:45,402
that I don't think non-procrastinators exist.

291
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:49,035
That's right -- I think all of you are procrastinators.

292
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:51,632
Now, you might not all be a mess,

293
00:12:51,656 --> 00:12:53,006
like some of us,

294
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,559
(Laughter)

295
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:57,899
and some of you may have a healthy relationship with deadlines,

296
00:12:57,923 --> 00:13:00,447
but remember: the Monkey's sneakiest trick

297
00:13:00,471 --> 00:13:02,311
is when the deadlines aren't there.

298
00:13:03,069 --> 00:13:05,101
Now, I want to show you one last thing.

299
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:07,498
I call this a Life Calendar.

300
00:13:08,172 --> 00:13:12,451
That's one box for every week of a 90-year life.

301
00:13:13,165 --> 00:13:14,754
That's not that many boxes,

302
00:13:14,778 --> 00:13:17,752
especially since we've already used a bunch of those.

303
00:13:18,427 --> 00:13:23,559
So I think we need to all take a long, hard look at that calendar.

304
00:13:24,797 --> 00:13:27,810
We need to think about what we're really procrastinating on,

305
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:31,199
because everyone is procrastinating on something in life.

306
00:13:32,602 --> 00:13:35,632
We need to stay aware of the Instant Gratification Monkey.

307
00:13:37,275 --> 00:13:39,767
That's a job for all of us.

308
00:13:40,489 --> 00:13:42,789
And because there's not that many boxes on there,

309
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:45,103
it's a job that should probably start today.

310
00:13:45,127 --> 00:13:48,127
Well, maybe not today, but ...

311
00:13:48,151 --> 00:13:49,792
(Laughter)

312
00:13:49,816 --> 00:13:50,966
You know.

313
00:13:51,396 --> 00:13:52,546
Sometime soon.

314
00:13:53,213 --> 00:13:54,422
Thank you.

315
00:13:54,446 --> 00:14:02,444
(Applause)
