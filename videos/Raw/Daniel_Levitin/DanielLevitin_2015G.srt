1
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,620
A few years ago, I broke into my own house.

2
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,916
I had just driven home,

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:20,476
it was around midnight in the dead of Montreal winter,

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,796
I had been visiting my friend, Jeff, across town,

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:27,596
and the thermometer on the front porch read minus 40 degrees --

6
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:30,716
and don't bother asking if that's Celsius or Fahrenheit,

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,196
minus 40 is where the two scales meet --

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:34,476
it was very cold.

9
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,716
And as I stood on the front porch fumbling in my pockets,

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,996
I found I didn't have my keys.

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,116
In fact, I could see them through the window,

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:45,236
lying on the dining room table where I had left them.

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:48,396
So I quickly ran around and tried all the other doors and windows,

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,996
and they were locked tight.

15
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:53,163
I thought about calling a locksmith -- at least I had my cellphone,

16
00:00:53,187 --> 00:00:56,516
but at midnight, it could take a while for a locksmith to show up,

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:00:58,700
and it was cold.

18
00:01:00,241 --> 00:01:02,956
I couldn't go back to my friend Jeff's house for the night

19
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,647
because I had an early flight to Europe the next morning,

20
00:01:05,671 --> 00:01:07,910
and I needed to get my passport and my suitcase.

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:10,716
So, desperate and freezing cold,

22
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,356
I found a large rock and I broke through the basement window,

23
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,356
cleared out the shards of glass,

24
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:17,716
I crawled through,

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:21,156
I found a piece of cardboard and taped it up over the opening,

26
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,800
figuring that in the morning, on the way to the airport,

27
00:01:23,824 --> 00:01:26,596
I could call my contractor and ask him to fix it.

28
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,097
This was going to be expensive,

29
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:31,676
but probably no more expensive than a middle-of-the-night locksmith,

30
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,860
so I figured, under the circumstances, I was coming out even.

31
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,916
Now, I'm a neuroscientist by training

32
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:43,036
and I know a little bit about how the brain performs under stress.

33
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,596
It releases cortisol that raises your heart rate,

34
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,876
it modulates adrenaline levels

35
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,380
and it clouds your thinking.

36
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,876
So the next morning,

37
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,356
when I woke up on too little sleep,

38
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:58,116
worrying about the hole in the window,

39
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:00,916
and a mental note that I had to call my contractor,

40
00:02:00,940 --> 00:02:02,636
and the freezing temperatures,

41
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,116
and the meetings I had upcoming in Europe,

42
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:08,676
and, you know, with all the cortisol in my brain,

43
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,076
my thinking was cloudy,

44
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,516
but I didn't know it was cloudy because my thinking was cloudy.

45
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,036
(Laughter)

46
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,316
And it wasn't until I got to the airport check-in counter,

47
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,596
that I realized I didn't have my passport.

48
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:22,636
(Laughter)

49
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,116
So I raced home in the snow and ice, 40 minutes,

50
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,596
got my passport, raced back to the airport,

51
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,436
I made it just in time,

52
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,699
but they had given away my seat to someone else,

53
00:02:32,723 --> 00:02:35,699
so I got stuck in the back of the plane, next to the bathrooms,

54
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:38,940
in a seat that wouldn't recline, on an eight-hour flight.

55
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:43,156
Well, I had a lot of time to think during those eight hours and no sleep.

56
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,316
(Laughter)

57
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,996
And I started wondering, are there things that I can do,

58
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:48,956
systems that I can put into place,

59
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,436
that will prevent bad things from happening?

60
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,356
Or at least if bad things happen,

61
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:58,380
will minimize the likelihood of it being a total catastrophe.

62
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,756
So I started thinking about that,

63
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,638
but my thoughts didn't crystallize until about a month later.

64
00:03:03,662 --> 00:03:07,356
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny Kahneman, the Nobel Prize winner,

65
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:10,756
and I somewhat embarrassedly told him about having broken my window,

66
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:13,196
and, you know, forgotten my passport,

67
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,436
and Danny shared with me

68
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,956
that he'd been practicing something called prospective hindsight.

69
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,716
(Laughter)

70
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,883
It's something that he had gotten from the psychologist Gary Klein,

71
00:03:23,907 --> 00:03:25,956
who had written about it a few years before,

72
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,076
also called the pre-mortem.

73
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,053
Now, you all know what the postmortem is.

74
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,556
Whenever there's a disaster,

75
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:35,876
a team of experts come in and they try to figure out what went wrong, right?

76
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,316
Well, in the pre-mortem, Danny explained,

77
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,236
you look ahead and you try to figure out all the things that could go wrong,

78
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,836
and then you try to figure out what you can do

79
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,356
to prevent those things from happening, or to minimize the damage.

80
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,316
So what I want to talk to you about today

81
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:54,876
are some of the things we can do in the form of a pre-mortem.

82
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,796
Some of them are obvious, some of them are not so obvious.

83
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:59,756
I'll start with the obvious ones.

84
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:04,860
Around the home, designate a place for things that are easily lost.

85
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,356
Now, this sounds like common sense, and it is,

86
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,916
but there's a lot of science to back this up,

87
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:15,236
based on the way our spatial memory works.

88
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:18,116
There's a structure in the brain called the hippocampus,

89
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:21,076
that evolved over tens of thousands of years,

90
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:24,876
to keep track of the locations of important things --

91
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,316
where the well is, where fish can be found,

92
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:29,836
that stand of fruit trees,

93
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,476
where the friendly and enemy tribes live.

94
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:34,405
The hippocampus is the part of the brain

95
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:37,916
that in London taxicab drivers becomes enlarged.

96
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,636
It's the part of the brain that allows squirrels to find their nuts.

97
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,518
And if you're wondering, somebody actually did the experiment

98
00:04:44,542 --> 00:04:47,316
where they cut off the olfactory sense of the squirrels,

99
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,156
and they could still find their nuts.

100
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,996
They weren't using smell, they were using the hippocampus,

101
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:57,036
this exquisitely evolved mechanism in the brain for finding things.

102
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,796
But it's really good for things that don't move around much,

103
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:03,276
not so good for things that move around.

104
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:07,596
So this is why we lose car keys and reading glasses and passports.

105
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,116
So in the home, designate a spot for your keys --

106
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:12,996
a hook by the door, maybe a decorative bowl.

107
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,116
For your passport, a particular drawer.

108
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:17,916
For your reading glasses, a particular table.

109
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,396
If you designate a spot and you're scrupulous about it,

110
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:24,236
your things will always be there when you look for them.

111
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,476
What about travel?

112
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,876
Take a cell phone picture of your credit cards,

113
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,196
your driver's license, your passport,

114
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:32,476
mail it to yourself so it's in the cloud.

115
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:36,876
If these things are lost or stolen, you can facilitate replacement.

116
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:39,516
Now these are some rather obvious things.

117
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,076
Remember, when you're under stress, the brain releases cortisol.

118
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,316
Cortisol is toxic, and it causes cloudy thinking.

119
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,876
So part of the practice of the pre-mortem

120
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:53,156
is to recognize that under stress you're not going to be at your best,

121
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,476
and you should put systems in place.

122
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,436
And there's perhaps no more stressful a situation

123
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,876
than when you're confronted with a medical decision to make.

124
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:05,196
And at some point, all of us are going to be in that position,

125
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:07,596
where we have to make a very important decision

126
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:10,916
about the future of our medical care or that of a loved one,

127
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:12,596
to help them with a decision.

128
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,236
And so I want to talk about that.

129
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,276
And I'm going to talk about a very particular medical condition.

130
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,836
But this stands as a proxy for all kinds of medical decision-making,

131
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:24,876
and indeed for financial decision-making, and social decision-making --

132
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,156
any kind of decision you have to make

133
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,196
that would benefit from a rational assessment of the facts.

134
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,356
So suppose you go to your doctor and the doctor says,

135
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:38,500
"I just got your lab work back, your cholesterol's a little high."

136
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:42,076
Now, you all know that high cholesterol

137
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,236
is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease,

138
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,676
heart attack, stroke.

139
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,916
And so you're thinking

140
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:51,036
having high cholesterol isn't the best thing,

141
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:54,076
and so the doctor says, "You know, I'd like to give you a drug

142
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,876
that will help you lower your cholesterol, a statin."

143
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,796
And you've probably heard of statins,

144
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,630
you know that they're among the most widely prescribed drugs

145
00:07:01,654 --> 00:07:02,828
in the world today,

146
00:07:02,852 --> 00:07:04,931
you probably even know people who take them.

147
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:07,336
And so you're thinking, "Yeah! Give me the statin."

148
00:07:07,361 --> 00:07:09,796
But there's a question you should ask at this point,

149
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,676
a statistic you should ask for

150
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,156
that most doctors don't like talking about,

151
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:17,340
and pharmaceutical companies like talking about even less.

152
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:20,996
It's for the number needed to treat.

153
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:22,996
Now, what is this, the NNT?

154
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:26,076
It's the number of people that need to take a drug

155
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,956
or undergo a surgery or any medical procedure

156
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,356
before one person is helped.

157
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,236
And you're thinking, what kind of crazy statistic is that?

158
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,476
The number should be one.

159
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,556
My doctor wouldn't prescribe something to me

160
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,865
if it's not going to help.

161
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:41,373
But actually, medical practice doesn't work that way.

162
00:07:41,398 --> 00:07:42,929
And it's not the doctor's fault,

163
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:45,873
if it's anybody's fault, it's the fault of scientists like me.

164
00:07:45,897 --> 00:07:48,762
We haven't figured out the underlying mechanisms well enough.

165
00:07:48,786 --> 00:07:51,196
But GlaxoSmithKline estimates

166
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:56,196
that 90 percent of the drugs work in only 30 to 50 percent of the people.

167
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,036
So the number needed to treat for the most widely prescribed statin,

168
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,196
what do you suppose it is?

169
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,036
How many people have to take it before one person is helped?

170
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,260
300.

171
00:08:06,895 --> 00:08:08,276
This is according to research

172
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,796
by research practitioners Jerome Groopman and Pamela Hartzband,

173
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,596
independently confirmed by Bloomberg.com.

174
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:17,020
I ran through the numbers myself.

175
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,116
300 people have to take the drug for a year

176
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,116
before one heart attack, stroke or other adverse event is prevented.

177
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,521
Now you're probably thinking,

178
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:28,356
"Well, OK, one in 300 chance of lowering my cholesterol.

179
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:30,596
Why not, doc? Give me the prescription anyway."

180
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:33,476
But you should ask at this point for another statistic,

181
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,076
and that is, "Tell me about the side effects." Right?

182
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,756
So for this particular drug,

183
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:41,436
the side effects occur in five percent of the patients.

184
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,127
And they include terrible things --

185
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:47,595
debilitating muscle and joint pain, gastrointestinal distress --

186
00:08:47,619 --> 00:08:49,478
but now you're thinking, "Five percent,

187
00:08:49,502 --> 00:08:51,516
not very likely it's going to happen to me,

188
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,778
I'll still take the drug."

189
00:08:52,802 --> 00:08:53,996
But wait a minute.

190
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,356
Remember under stress you're not thinking clearly.

191
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:59,545
So think about how you're going to work through this ahead of time,

192
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,768
so you don't have to manufacture the chain of reasoning on the spot.

193
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:05,285
300 people take the drug, right? One person's helped,

194
00:09:05,309 --> 00:09:07,716
five percent of those 300 have side effects,

195
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,220
that's 15 people.

196
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:13,516
You're 15 times more likely to be harmed by the drug

197
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:16,356
than you are to be helped by the drug.

198
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,285
Now, I'm not saying whether you should take the statin or not.

199
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,452
I'm just saying you should have this conversation with your doctor.

200
00:09:22,476 --> 00:09:23,796
Medical ethics requires it,

201
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:26,116
it's part of the principle of informed consent.

202
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:29,356
You have the right to have access to this kind of information

203
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:33,276
to begin the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.

204
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:34,516
Now you might be thinking

205
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,236
I've pulled this number out of the air for shock value,

206
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,516
but in fact it's rather typical, this number needed to treat.

207
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:45,156
For the most widely performed surgery on men over the age of 50,

208
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:47,396
removal of the prostate for cancer,

209
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,996
the number needed to treat is 49.

210
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,196
That's right, 49 surgeries are done for every one person who's helped.

211
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,876
And the side effects in that case occur in 50 percent of the patients.

212
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,756
They include impotence, erectile dysfunction,

213
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:04,556
urinary incontinence, rectal tearing,

214
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,036
fecal incontinence.

215
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,556
And if you're lucky, and you're one of the 50 percent who has these,

216
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,620
they'll only last for a year or two.

217
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:16,316
So the idea of the pre-mortem is to think ahead of time

218
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,876
to the questions that you might be able to ask

219
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,276
that will push the conversation forward.

220
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:24,396
You don't want to have to manufacture all of this on the spot.

221
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,316
And you also want to think about things like quality of life.

222
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:29,116
Because you have a choice oftentimes,

223
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:31,436
do you I want a shorter life that's pain-free,

224
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:35,236
or a longer life that might have a great deal of pain towards the end?

225
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,676
These are things to talk about and think about now,

226
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,516
with your family and your loved ones.

227
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,036
You might change your mind in the heat of the moment,

228
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:45,116
but at least you're practiced with this kind of thinking.

229
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:49,756
Remember, our brain under stress releases cortisol,

230
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:52,116
and one of the things that happens at that moment

231
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:54,076
is a whole bunch on systems shut down.

232
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,005
There's an evolutionary reason for this.

233
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:59,436
Face-to-face with a predator, you don't need your digestive system,

234
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,916
or your libido, or your immune system,

235
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:05,596
because if you're body is expending metabolism on those things

236
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:07,276
and you don't react quickly,

237
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,276
you might become the lion's lunch, and then none of those things matter.

238
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,716
Unfortunately,

239
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,356
one of the things that goes out the window during those times of stress

240
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:18,356
is rational, logical thinking,

241
00:11:18,380 --> 00:11:21,796
as Danny Kahneman and his colleagues have shown.

242
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:24,996
So we need to train ourselves to think ahead

243
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,276
to these kinds of situations.

244
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:33,476
I think the important point here is recognizing that all of us are flawed.

245
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,356
We all are going to fail now and then.

246
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,996
The idea is to think ahead to what those failures might be,

247
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,916
to put systems in place that will help minimize the damage,

248
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,460
or to prevent the bad things from happening in the first place.

249
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,756
Getting back to that snowy night in Montreal,

250
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,516
when I got back from my trip,

251
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,396
I had my contractor install a combination lock next to the door,

252
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,956
with a key to the front door in it, an easy to remember combination.

253
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,196
And I have to admit,

254
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:04,636
I still have piles of mail that haven't been sorted,

255
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:07,236
and piles of emails that I haven't gone through.

256
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,036
So I'm not completely organized,

257
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,196
but I see organization as a gradual process,

258
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,436
and I'm getting there.

259
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,676
Thank you very much.

260
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:19,092
(Applause)
