1
00:00:12.993 --> 00:00:16.622
I wanted to talk to you today about creative confidence.

2
00:00:17.263 --> 00:00:20.407
I'm going to start way back in the third grade

3
00:00:20.431 --> 00:00:23.352
at Oakdale School in Barberton, Ohio.

4
00:00:23.817 --> 00:00:27.797
I remember one day my best friend Brian was working on a project.

5
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.673
He was making a horse out of the clay our teacher kept under the sink.

6
00:00:33.936 --> 00:00:37.495
And at one point, one of the girls that was sitting at his table,

7
00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:41.133
seeing what he was doing, leaned over and said to him,

8
00:00:41.157 --> 00:00:44.211
"That's terrible. That doesn't look anything like a horse."

9
00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:47.363
And Brian's shoulders sank.

10
00:00:47.387 --> 00:00:50.700
And he wadded up the clay horse and he threw it back in the bin.

11
00:00:51.605 --> 00:00:55.909
I never saw Brian do a project like that ever again.

12
00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:59.076
And I wonder how often that happens, you know?

13
00:00:59.916 --> 00:01:03.401
It seems like when I tell that story of Brian to my class,

14
00:01:04.846 --> 00:01:06.869
a lot of them want to come up after class

15
00:01:06.893 --> 00:01:08.910
and tell me about their similar experience,

16
00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:10.544
how a teacher shut them down,

17
00:01:10.568 --> 00:01:13.229
or how a student was particularly cruel to them.

18
00:01:13.253 --> 00:01:16.795
And then some kind of opt out of thinking of themselves as creative

19
00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:17.974
at that point.

20
00:01:18.975 --> 00:01:22.597
And I see that opting out that happens in childhood,

21
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:25.916
and it moves in and becomes more ingrained, even,

22
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.940
by the time you get to adult life.

23
00:01:29.961 --> 00:01:34.098
So we see a lot of this.

24
00:01:34.122 --> 00:01:35.522
When we have a workshop

25
00:01:35.546 --> 00:01:38.292
or when we have clients in to work with us side by side,

26
00:01:38.316 --> 00:01:40.593
eventually we get to the point in the process

27
00:01:40.617 --> 00:01:42.938
that's kind of fuzzy or unconventional.

28
00:01:43.563 --> 00:01:47.101
And eventually, these big-shot executives whip out their BlackBerrys

29
00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:50.670
and they say they have to make really important phone calls,

30
00:01:50.694 --> 00:01:52.265
and they head for the exits.

31
00:01:52.838 --> 00:01:54.674
And they're just so uncomfortable.

32
00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.729
When we track them down and ask them what's going on,

33
00:01:57.753 --> 00:02:00.676
they say something like, "I'm just not the creative type."

34
00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:03.007
But we know that's not true.

35
00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:06.191
If they stick with the process, if they stick with it,

36
00:02:06.215 --> 00:02:08.436
they end up doing amazing things.

37
00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:11.410
And they surprise themselves at just how innovative

38
00:02:11.434 --> 00:02:13.605
they and their teams really are.

39
00:02:14.928 --> 00:02:19.514
So I've been looking at this fear of judgment that we have,

40
00:02:19.538 --> 00:02:23.020
that you don't do things, you're afraid you're going to be judged;

41
00:02:23.044 --> 00:02:26.841
if you don't say the right creative thing, you're going to be judged.

42
00:02:27.574 --> 00:02:29.536
And I had a major breakthrough,

43
00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.727
when I met the psychologist Albert Bandura.

44
00:02:33.751 --> 00:02:37.028
I don't know if you know Albert Bandura, but if you go to Wikipedia,

45
00:02:37.052 --> 00:02:41.194
it says that he's the fourth most important psychologist in history --

46
00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:44.927
you know, like Freud, Skinner, somebody and Bandura.

47
00:02:44.951 --> 00:02:46.363
(Laughter)

48
00:02:46.387 --> 00:02:49.371
Bandura is 86 and he still works at Stanford.

49
00:02:49.395 --> 00:02:51.151
And he's just a lovely guy.

50
00:02:52.902 --> 00:02:54.182
So I went to see him,

51
00:02:54.206 --> 00:02:57.708
because he's just worked on phobias for a long time,

52
00:02:57.732 --> 00:02:59.165
which I'm very interested in.

53
00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.427
He had developed this way,

54
00:03:03.451 --> 00:03:06.177
this, kind of, methodology,

55
00:03:06.201 --> 00:03:09.152
that ended up curing people in a very short amount of time,

56
00:03:09.176 --> 00:03:10.535
like, in four hours.

57
00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:13.995
He had a huge cure rate of people who had phobias.

58
00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:16.983
And we talked about snakes -- I don't know why --

59
00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:21.189
we talked about snakes and fear of snakes as a phobia.

60
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:25.047
And it was really enjoyable, really interesting.

61
00:03:25.071 --> 00:03:30.014
He told me that he'd invite the test subject in,

62
00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:32.925
and he'd say, "You know, there's a snake in the next room

63
00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:34.553
and we're going to go in there."

64
00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:38.381
To which, he reported, most of them replied,

65
00:03:38.405 --> 00:03:43.185
"Hell no! I'm not going in there, certainly if there's a snake in there."

66
00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:47.509
But Bandura has a step-by-step process that was super successful.

67
00:03:47.533 --> 00:03:50.439
So he'd take people to this two-way mirror

68
00:03:50.463 --> 00:03:52.758
looking into the room where the snake was.

69
00:03:53.188 --> 00:03:55.228
And he'd get them comfortable with that.

70
00:03:55.252 --> 00:03:56.808
Then through a series of steps,

71
00:03:56.832 --> 00:04:00.517
he'd move them and they'd be standing in the doorway with the door open,

72
00:04:00.541 --> 00:04:02.055
and they'd be looking in there.

73
00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.026
And he'd get them comfortable with that.

74
00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.740
And then many more steps later, baby steps,

75
00:04:06.764 --> 00:04:10.836
they'd be in the room, they'd have a leather glove like a welder's glove on,

76
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.514
and they'd eventually touch the snake.

77
00:04:14.395 --> 00:04:18.999
And when they touched the snake, everything was fine. They were cured.

78
00:04:19.023 --> 00:04:21.143
In fact, everything was better than fine.

79
00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:24.420
These people who had lifelong fears of snakes

80
00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:26.549
were saying things like,

81
00:04:27.216 --> 00:04:29.194
"Look how beautiful that snake is."

82
00:04:29.218 --> 00:04:32.333
And they were holding it in their laps.

83
00:04:33.493 --> 00:04:37.046
Bandura calls this process "guided mastery."

84
00:04:37.402 --> 00:04:39.989
I love that term: guided mastery.

85
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:42.581
And something else happened.

86
00:04:43.042 --> 00:04:46.544
These people who went through the process and touched the snake

87
00:04:46.568 --> 00:04:50.071
ended up having less anxiety about other things in their lives.

88
00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:53.911
They tried harder, they persevered longer,

89
00:04:53.935 --> 00:04:56.691
and they were more resilient in the face of failure.

90
00:04:57.648 --> 00:05:00.368
They just gained a new confidence.

91
00:05:01.959 --> 00:05:06.038
And Bandura calls that confidence "self-efficacy,"

92
00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.307
the sense that you can change the world

93
00:05:09.331 --> 00:05:12.155
and that you can attain what you set out to do.

94
00:05:13.277 --> 00:05:16.041
Well, meeting Bandura was really cathartic for me,

95
00:05:16.065 --> 00:05:19.598
because I realized that this famous scientist

96
00:05:19.622 --> 00:05:22.782
had documented and scientifically validated

97
00:05:22.806 --> 00:05:26.197
something that we've seen happen for the last 30 years:

98
00:05:26.221 --> 00:05:30.010
that we could take people who had the fear that they weren't creative,

99
00:05:30.034 --> 00:05:32.760
and we could take them through a series of steps,

100
00:05:32.784 --> 00:05:36.180
kind of like a series of small successes,

101
00:05:36.204 --> 00:05:39.554
and they turn fear into familiarity.

102
00:05:40.135 --> 00:05:41.610
And they surprise themselves.

103
00:05:41.634 --> 00:05:43.637
That transformation is amazing.

104
00:05:43.661 --> 00:05:46.057
We see it at the d.school all the time.

105
00:05:46.081 --> 00:05:48.787
People from all different kinds of disciplines,

106
00:05:48.811 --> 00:05:51.302
they think of themselves as only analytical.

107
00:05:51.326 --> 00:05:54.830
And they come in and they go through the process, our process,

108
00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:58.036
they build confidence and now they think of themselves differently.

109
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:03.125
And they're totally emotionally excited about the fact that they walk around

110
00:06:03.149 --> 00:06:05.412
thinking of themselves as a creative person.

111
00:06:07.386 --> 00:06:09.442
So I thought one of the things I'd do today

112
00:06:09.466 --> 00:06:12.668
is take you through and show you what this journey looks like.

113
00:06:13.298 --> 00:06:17.792
To me, that journey looks like Doug Dietz.

114
00:06:20.046 --> 00:06:21.960
Doug Dietz is a technical person.

115
00:06:21.984 --> 00:06:25.782
He designs large medical imaging equipment.

116
00:06:26.252 --> 00:06:29.512
He's worked for GE, and he's had a fantastic career.

117
00:06:30.062 --> 00:06:32.488
But at one point, he had a moment of crisis.

118
00:06:32.886 --> 00:06:36.959
He was in the hospital looking at one of his MRI machines in use,

119
00:06:36.983 --> 00:06:40.230
when he saw a young family, and this little girl.

120
00:06:40.607 --> 00:06:44.059
And that little girl was crying and was terrified.

121
00:06:44.083 --> 00:06:46.629
And Doug was really disappointed to learn

122
00:06:47.462 --> 00:06:51.317
that nearly 80 percent of the pediatric patients in this hospital

123
00:06:51.341 --> 00:06:55.059
had to be sedated in order to deal with his MRI machine.

124
00:06:56.885 --> 00:06:58.964
And this was really disappointing to Doug,

125
00:06:58.988 --> 00:07:01.641
because before this time, he was proud of what he did.

126
00:07:01.665 --> 00:07:03.796
He was saving lives with this machine.

127
00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:08.777
But it really hurt him to see the fear that this machine caused in kids.

128
00:07:09.258 --> 00:07:13.718
About that time, he was at the d.school at Stanford taking classes.

129
00:07:13.742 --> 00:07:18.393
He was learning about our process, about design thinking, about empathy,

130
00:07:18.417 --> 00:07:20.242
about iterative prototyping.

131
00:07:20.266 --> 00:07:24.955
And he would take this new knowledge and do something quite extraordinary.

132
00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:28.716
He would redesign the entire experience

133
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:29.978
of being scanned.

134
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:31.979
And this is what he came up with.

135
00:07:32.003 --> 00:07:33.022
(Laughter)

136
00:07:33.046 --> 00:07:35.619
He turned it into an adventure for the kids.

137
00:07:35.643 --> 00:07:37.901
He painted the walls and he painted the machine,

138
00:07:37.925 --> 00:07:40.704
and he got the operators retrained by people who know kids,

139
00:07:40.728 --> 00:07:43.238
like children's museum people.

140
00:07:43.262 --> 00:07:46.960
And now when the kid comes, it's an experience.

141
00:07:46.984 --> 00:07:50.590
And they talk to them about the noise and the movement of the ship.

142
00:07:50.614 --> 00:07:52.011
And when they come, they say,

143
00:07:52.035 --> 00:07:54.162
"OK, you're going to go into the pirate ship,

144
00:07:54.186 --> 00:07:57.703
but be very still, because we don't want the pirates to find you."

145
00:07:59.134 --> 00:08:01.890
And the results were super dramatic:

146
00:08:02.794 --> 00:08:05.944
from something like 80 percent of the kids needing to be sedated,

147
00:08:05.968 --> 00:08:10.222
to something like 10 percent of the kids needing to be sedated.

148
00:08:10.246 --> 00:08:12.285
And the hospital and GE were happy, too,

149
00:08:12.309 --> 00:08:15.468
because you didn't have to call the anesthesiologist all the time,

150
00:08:15.492 --> 00:08:18.300
and they could put more kids through the machine in a day.

151
00:08:18.324 --> 00:08:20.231
So the quantitative results were great.

152
00:08:20.255 --> 00:08:23.921
But Doug's results that he cared about were much more qualitative.

153
00:08:24.283 --> 00:08:26.009
He was with one of the mothers

154
00:08:26.033 --> 00:08:28.343
waiting for her child to come out of the scan.

155
00:08:28.367 --> 00:08:30.733
And when the little girl came out of her scan,

156
00:08:30.757 --> 00:08:32.653
she ran up to her mother and said,

157
00:08:32.677 --> 00:08:34.617
"Mommy, can we come back tomorrow?"

158
00:08:34.641 --> 00:08:36.869
(Laughter)

159
00:08:37.866 --> 00:08:41.287
And so, I've heard Doug tell the story many times

160
00:08:41.311 --> 00:08:43.597
of his personal transformation

161
00:08:43.621 --> 00:08:46.967
and the breakthrough design that happened from it,

162
00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:50.102
but I've never really seen him tell the story of the little girl

163
00:08:50.126 --> 00:08:51.563
without a tear in his eye.

164
00:08:51.875 --> 00:08:54.140
Doug's story takes place in a hospital.

165
00:08:54.841 --> 00:08:57.020
I know a thing or two about hospitals.

166
00:08:58.290 --> 00:09:01.460
A few years ago, I felt a lump on the side of my neck.

167
00:09:03.031 --> 00:09:05.226
It was my turn in the MRI machine.

168
00:09:05.784 --> 00:09:08.744
It was cancer, it was the bad kind.

169
00:09:08.768 --> 00:09:11.927
I was told I had a 40 percent chance of survival.

170
00:09:12.723 --> 00:09:15.629
So while you're sitting around with the other patients,

171
00:09:15.653 --> 00:09:16.877
in your pajamas,

172
00:09:16.901 --> 00:09:18.929
and everybody's pale and thin --

173
00:09:18.953 --> 00:09:19.969
(Laughter)

174
00:09:19.993 --> 00:09:23.258
you know? -- and you're waiting for your turn to get the gamma rays,

175
00:09:23.282 --> 00:09:24.934
you think of a lot of things.

176
00:09:24.958 --> 00:09:27.536
Mostly, you think about: Am I going to survive?

177
00:09:28.201 --> 00:09:29.469
And I thought a lot about:

178
00:09:29.493 --> 00:09:32.411
What was my daughter's life going to be like without me?

179
00:09:34.316 --> 00:09:36.734
But you think about other things.

180
00:09:36.758 --> 00:09:39.744
I thought a lot about: What was I put on Earth to do?

181
00:09:39.768 --> 00:09:43.010
What was my calling? What should I do?

182
00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:45.231
I was lucky because I had lots of options.

183
00:09:45.255 --> 00:09:47.214
We'd been working in health and wellness,

184
00:09:47.238 --> 00:09:49.336
and K-12, and the developing world.

185
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.012
so there were lots of projects that I could work on.

186
00:09:52.432 --> 00:09:54.750
But then I decided and committed at this point,

187
00:09:54.774 --> 00:09:56.619
to the thing I most wanted to do,

188
00:09:58.054 --> 00:10:01.745
which was to help as many people as possible

189
00:10:01.769 --> 00:10:04.901
regain the creative confidence they lost along their way.

190
00:10:05.642 --> 00:10:08.466
And if I was going to survive, that's what I wanted to do.

191
00:10:08.490 --> 00:10:09.951
I survived, just so you know.

192
00:10:09.975 --> 00:10:12.046
(Laughter)

193
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:18.689
(Applause)

194
00:10:18.803 --> 00:10:22.708
I really believe that when people gain this confidence --

195
00:10:22.732 --> 00:10:25.733
and we see it all the time at the d.school and at IDEO --

196
00:10:25.757 --> 00:10:28.555
that they actually start working on the things

197
00:10:28.579 --> 00:10:30.566
that are really important in their lives.

198
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:34.301
We see people quit what they're doing and go in new directions.

199
00:10:34.325 --> 00:10:40.774
We see them come up with more interesting -- and just more -- ideas,

200
00:10:40.798 --> 00:10:43.701
so they can choose from better ideas.

201
00:10:43.725 --> 00:10:45.748
And they just make better decisions.

202
00:10:46.318 --> 00:10:49.811
I know at TED, you're supposed to have a change-the-world kind of thing,

203
00:10:49.835 --> 00:10:52.535
isn't that -- everybody has a change-the-world thing?

204
00:10:52.559 --> 00:10:55.686
If there is one for me, this is it, to help this happen.

205
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.450
So I hope you'll join me on my quest,

206
00:10:58.474 --> 00:11:00.084
you as, kind of, thought leaders.

207
00:11:00.108 --> 00:11:04.349
It would be really great if you didn't let people divide the world

208
00:11:04.373 --> 00:11:08.335
into the creatives and the non-creatives, like it's some God-given thing,

209
00:11:08.359 --> 00:11:12.715
and to have people realize that they're naturally creative,

210
00:11:12.869 --> 00:11:16.398
and that those natural people should let their ideas fly;

211
00:11:17.485 --> 00:11:21.661
that they should achieve what Bandura calls self-efficacy,

212
00:11:21.685 --> 00:11:24.948
that you can do what you set out to do,

213
00:11:24.972 --> 00:11:28.660
and that you can reach a place of creative confidence

214
00:11:28.684 --> 00:11:30.368
and touch the snake.

215
00:11:30.392 --> 00:11:31.544
Thank you.

216
00:11:31.568 --> 00:11:37.883
(Applause)
