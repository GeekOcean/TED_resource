1
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:15,320
When people find out I write about time management,

2
00:00:16,408 --> 00:00:18,083
they assume two things.

3
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:22,368
One is that I'm always on time,

4
00:00:23,567 --> 00:00:24,804
and I'm not.

5
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:26,690
I have four small children,

6
00:00:26,714 --> 00:00:29,530
and I would like to blame them for my occasional tardiness,

7
00:00:29,554 --> 00:00:31,662
but sometimes it's just not their fault.

8
00:00:32,185 --> 00:00:34,932
I was once late to my own speech on time management.

9
00:00:34,956 --> 00:00:35,996
(Laughter)

10
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:39,593
We all had to just take a moment together and savor that irony.

11
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:44,011
The second thing they assume is that I have lots of tips and tricks

12
00:00:44,035 --> 00:00:45,928
for saving bits of time here and there.

13
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:49,666
Sometimes I'll hear from magazines that are doing a story along these lines,

14
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:53,017
generally on how to help their readers find an extra hour in the day.

15
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,327
And the idea is that we'll shave bits of time off everyday activities,

16
00:00:56,351 --> 00:00:57,528
add it up,

17
00:00:57,552 --> 00:00:59,726
and we'll have time for the good stuff.

18
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,784
I question the entire premise of this piece, but I'm always interested

19
00:01:03,808 --> 00:01:06,491
in hearing what they've come up with before they call me.

20
00:01:06,515 --> 00:01:07,667
Some of my favorites:

21
00:01:07,691 --> 00:01:10,597
doing errands where you only have to make right-hand turns --

22
00:01:10,621 --> 00:01:11,649
(Laughter)

23
00:01:11,673 --> 00:01:13,819
Being extremely judicious in microwave usage:

24
00:01:13,843 --> 00:01:16,566
it says three to three-and-a-half minutes on the package,

25
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,026
we're totally getting in on the bottom side of that.

26
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:21,789
And my personal favorite, which makes sense on some level,

27
00:01:21,813 --> 00:01:25,565
is to DVR your favorite shows so you can fast-forward through the commercials.

28
00:01:25,589 --> 00:01:27,881
That way, you save eight minutes every half hour,

29
00:01:27,905 --> 00:01:30,002
so in the course of two hours of watching TV,

30
00:01:30,026 --> 00:01:31,569
you find 32 minutes to exercise.

31
00:01:31,593 --> 00:01:32,609
(Laughter)

32
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:33,918
Which is true.

33
00:01:34,407 --> 00:01:37,028
You know another way to find 32 minutes to exercise?

34
00:01:37,449 --> 00:01:39,781
Don't watch two hours of TV a day, right?

35
00:01:39,805 --> 00:01:40,821
(Laughter)

36
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:44,319
Anyway, the idea is we'll save bits of time here and there, add it up,

37
00:01:44,343 --> 00:01:46,627
we will finally get to everything we want to do.

38
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:49,563
But after studying how successful people spend their time

39
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:52,224
and looking at their schedules hour by hour,

40
00:01:52,248 --> 00:01:55,544
I think this idea has it completely backward.

41
00:01:56,125 --> 00:01:59,767
We don't build the lives we want by saving time.

42
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:01,946
We build the lives we want,

43
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,423
and then time saves itself.

44
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:08,165
Here's what I mean.

45
00:02:08,189 --> 00:02:09,883
I recently did a time diary project

46
00:02:09,907 --> 00:02:14,111
looking at 1,001 days in the lives of extremely busy women.

47
00:02:14,135 --> 00:02:16,779
They had demanding jobs, sometimes their own businesses,

48
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,938
kids to care for, maybe parents to care for,

49
00:02:18,962 --> 00:02:20,292
community commitments --

50
00:02:20,316 --> 00:02:22,129
busy, busy people.

51
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:24,826
I had them keep track of their time for a week

52
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:27,163
so I could add up how much they worked and slept,

53
00:02:27,187 --> 00:02:29,996
and I interviewed them about their strategies, for my book.

54
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,009
One of the women whose time log I studied

55
00:02:32,033 --> 00:02:34,096
goes out on a Wednesday night for something.

56
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,749
She comes home to find that her water heater has broken,

57
00:02:36,773 --> 00:02:39,409
and there is now water all over her basement.

58
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,654
If you've ever had anything like this happen to you,

59
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:45,558
you know it is a hugely damaging, frightening, sopping mess.

60
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:48,292
So she's dealing with the immediate aftermath that night,

61
00:02:48,316 --> 00:02:50,193
next day she's got plumbers coming in,

62
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:53,717
day after that, professional cleaning crew dealing with the ruined carpet.

63
00:02:53,741 --> 00:02:55,807
All this is being recorded on her time log.

64
00:02:55,831 --> 00:02:58,131
Winds up taking seven hours of her week.

65
00:02:59,011 --> 00:03:00,293
Seven hours.

66
00:03:00,999 --> 00:03:03,801
That's like finding an extra hour in the day.

67
00:03:04,654 --> 00:03:07,448
But I'm sure if you had asked her at the start of the week,

68
00:03:07,472 --> 00:03:10,690
"Could you find seven hours to train for a triathlon?"

69
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:15,518
"Could you find seven hours to mentor seven worthy people?"

70
00:03:15,542 --> 00:03:18,233
I'm sure she would've said what most of us would've said,

71
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:22,701
which is, "No -- can't you see how busy I am?"

72
00:03:23,341 --> 00:03:25,138
Yet when she had to find seven hours

73
00:03:25,162 --> 00:03:27,961
because there is water all over her basement,

74
00:03:27,985 --> 00:03:30,495
she found seven hours.

75
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:35,026
And what this shows us is that time is highly elastic.

76
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:37,457
We cannot make more time,

77
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:41,660
but time will stretch to accommodate what we choose to put into it.

78
00:03:42,186 --> 00:03:44,753
And so the key to time management

79
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,596
is treating our priorities

80
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:50,667
as the equivalent of that broken water heater.

81
00:03:51,982 --> 00:03:53,132
To get at this,

82
00:03:53,156 --> 00:03:56,601
I like to use language from one of the busiest people I ever interviewed.

83
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:58,913
By busy, I mean she was running a small business

84
00:03:58,937 --> 00:04:00,406
with 12 people on the payroll,

85
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,453
she had six children in her spare time.

86
00:04:02,477 --> 00:04:05,095
I was getting in touch with her to set up an interview

87
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:07,615
on how she "had it all" -- that phrase.

88
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,448
I remember it was a Thursday morning,

89
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:11,479
and she was not available to speak with me.

90
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:12,659
Of course, right?

91
00:04:12,683 --> 00:04:15,102
But the reason she was unavailable to speak with me

92
00:04:15,126 --> 00:04:17,066
is that she was out for a hike,

93
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,128
because it was a beautiful spring morning,

94
00:04:19,152 --> 00:04:20,715
and she wanted to go for a hike.

95
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:23,076
So of course this makes me even more intrigued,

96
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:26,276
and when I finally do catch up with her, she explains it like this.

97
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:28,567
She says, "Listen Laura, everything I do,

98
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:33,025
every minute I spend, is my choice."

99
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:34,801
And rather than say,

100
00:04:34,825 --> 00:04:37,254
"I don't have time to do x, y or z,"

101
00:04:37,713 --> 00:04:42,827
she'd say, "I don't do x, y or z because it's not a priority."

102
00:04:43,529 --> 00:04:47,897
"I don't have time," often means "It's not a priority."

103
00:04:48,895 --> 00:04:51,783
If you think about it, that's really more accurate language.

104
00:04:51,807 --> 00:04:54,371
I could tell you I don't have time to dust my blinds,

105
00:04:54,395 --> 00:04:55,564
but that's not true.

106
00:04:55,588 --> 00:04:58,028
If you offered to pay me $100,000 to dust my blinds,

107
00:04:58,052 --> 00:04:59,652
I would get to it pretty quickly.

108
00:04:59,676 --> 00:05:00,692
(Laughter)

109
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:02,351
Since that is not going to happen,

110
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,979
I can acknowledge this is not a matter of lacking time;

111
00:05:05,003 --> 00:05:06,604
it's that I don't want to do it.

112
00:05:06,628 --> 00:05:10,014
Using this language reminds us that time is a choice.

113
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:11,211
And granted,

114
00:05:11,235 --> 00:05:14,267
there may be horrible consequences for making different choices,

115
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:15,497
I will give you that.

116
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:17,143
But we are smart people,

117
00:05:17,167 --> 00:05:19,025
and certainly over the long run,

118
00:05:19,049 --> 00:05:21,049
we have the power to fill our lives

119
00:05:21,073 --> 00:05:23,749
with the things that deserve to be there.

120
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,312
So how do we do that?

121
00:05:26,947 --> 00:05:28,379
How do we treat our priorities

122
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:30,734
as the equivalent of that broken water heater?

123
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:33,670
Well, first we need to figure out what they are.

124
00:05:33,694 --> 00:05:36,448
I want to give you two strategies for thinking about this.

125
00:05:36,472 --> 00:05:38,230
The first, on the professional side:

126
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:40,765
I'm sure many people coming up to the end of the year

127
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:43,112
are giving or getting annual performance reviews.

128
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:45,401
You look back over your successes over the year,

129
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,470
your "opportunities for growth."

130
00:05:47,494 --> 00:05:49,517
And this serves its purpose,

131
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,971
but I find it's more effective to do this looking forward.

132
00:05:52,995 --> 00:05:55,589
So I want you to pretend it's the end of next year.

133
00:05:56,146 --> 00:05:58,507
You're giving yourself a performance review,

134
00:05:58,531 --> 00:06:03,047
and it has been an absolutely amazing year for you professionally.

135
00:06:03,854 --> 00:06:09,641
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing?

136
00:06:10,554 --> 00:06:14,354
So you can write next year's performance review now.

137
00:06:14,378 --> 00:06:16,625
And you can do this for your personal life, too.

138
00:06:16,649 --> 00:06:19,278
I'm sure many of you, like me, come December,

139
00:06:19,302 --> 00:06:22,848
get cards that contain these folded up sheets of colored paper,

140
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:28,141
on which is written what is known as the family holiday letter.

141
00:06:28,165 --> 00:06:29,803
(Laughter)

142
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:32,458
Bit of a wretched genre of literature, really,

143
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:35,766
going on about how amazing everyone in the household is,

144
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:37,077
or even more scintillating,

145
00:06:37,101 --> 00:06:39,276
how busy everyone in the household is.

146
00:06:39,635 --> 00:06:41,284
But these letters serve a purpose,

147
00:06:41,308 --> 00:06:43,515
which is that they tell your friends and family

148
00:06:43,539 --> 00:06:46,864
what you did in your personal life that mattered to you over the year.

149
00:06:46,888 --> 00:06:48,272
So this year's kind of done,

150
00:06:48,296 --> 00:06:50,746
but I want you to pretend it's the end of next year,

151
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:53,524
and it has been an absolutely amazing year

152
00:06:53,992 --> 00:06:56,645
for you and the people you care about.

153
00:06:57,211 --> 00:07:01,914
What three to five things did you do that made it so amazing?

154
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:06,800
So you can write next year's family holiday letter now.

155
00:07:07,609 --> 00:07:08,802
Don't send it.

156
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:09,842
(Laughter)

157
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:12,504
Please, don't send it.

158
00:07:12,869 --> 00:07:14,259
But you can write it.

159
00:07:14,283 --> 00:07:17,997
And now, between the performance review and the family holiday letter,

160
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,258
we have a list of six to ten goals we can work on in the next year.

161
00:07:21,282 --> 00:07:24,081
And now we need to break these down into doable steps.

162
00:07:24,105 --> 00:07:26,313
So maybe you want to write a family history.

163
00:07:26,337 --> 00:07:28,590
First, you can read some other family histories,

164
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:29,876
get a sense for the style.

165
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:33,107
Then maybe think about the questions you want to ask your relatives,

166
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:34,980
set up appointments to interview them.

167
00:07:35,004 --> 00:07:36,465
Or maybe you want to run a 5K.

168
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:39,650
So you need to find a race and sign up, figure out a training plan,

169
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:42,047
and dig those shoes out of the back of the closet.

170
00:07:42,071 --> 00:07:44,013
And then -- this is key --

171
00:07:44,037 --> 00:07:48,132
we treat our priorities as the equivalent of that broken water heater,

172
00:07:48,156 --> 00:07:51,155
by putting them into our schedules first.

173
00:07:51,699 --> 00:07:56,459
We do this by thinking through our weeks before we are in them.

174
00:07:56,483 --> 00:08:00,167
I find a really good time to do this is Friday afternoons.

175
00:08:00,705 --> 00:08:03,253
Friday afternoon is what an economist might call

176
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:05,814
a "low opportunity cost" time.

177
00:08:06,584 --> 00:08:09,484
Most of us are not sitting there on Friday afternoons saying,

178
00:08:09,508 --> 00:08:11,387
"I am excited to make progress

179
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:13,707
toward my personal and professional priorities

180
00:08:13,731 --> 00:08:14,885
right now."

181
00:08:14,909 --> 00:08:15,925
(Laughter)

182
00:08:15,949 --> 00:08:18,566
But we are willing to think about what those should be.

183
00:08:18,590 --> 00:08:20,795
So take a little bit of time Friday afternoon,

184
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:27,009
make yourself a three-category priority list: career, relationships, self.

185
00:08:28,202 --> 00:08:31,400
Making a three-category list reminds us

186
00:08:31,424 --> 00:08:34,914
that there should be something in all three categories.

187
00:08:34,938 --> 00:08:36,194
Career, we think about;

188
00:08:36,218 --> 00:08:37,725
relationships, self --

189
00:08:37,749 --> 00:08:39,068
not so much.

190
00:08:39,092 --> 00:08:40,990
But anyway, just a short list,

191
00:08:41,014 --> 00:08:42,443
two to three items in each.

192
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,214
Then look out over the whole of the next week,

193
00:08:45,238 --> 00:08:46,953
and see where you can plan them in.

194
00:08:47,991 --> 00:08:50,001
Where you plan them in is up to you.

195
00:08:50,025 --> 00:08:53,487
I know this is going to be more complicated for some people than others.

196
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:57,033
I mean, some people's lives are just harder than others.

197
00:08:57,494 --> 00:09:00,763
It is not going to be easy to find time to take that poetry class

198
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:03,517
if you are caring for multiple children on your own.

199
00:09:03,878 --> 00:09:05,049
I get that.

200
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:07,280
And I don't want to minimize anyone's struggle.

201
00:09:07,304 --> 00:09:11,830
But I do think that the numbers I am about to tell you are empowering.

202
00:09:12,726 --> 00:09:16,733
There are 168 hours in a week.

203
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:22,483
Twenty-four times seven is 168 hours.

204
00:09:23,115 --> 00:09:25,848
That is a lot of time.

205
00:09:26,447 --> 00:09:29,638
If you are working a full-time job, so 40 hours a week,

206
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:32,754
sleeping eight hours a night, so 56 hours a week --

207
00:09:32,778 --> 00:09:35,358
that leaves 72 hours for other things.

208
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,349
That is a lot of time.

209
00:09:38,776 --> 00:09:40,661
You say you're working 50 hours a week,

210
00:09:40,685 --> 00:09:42,631
maybe a main job and a side hustle.

211
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,125
Well, that leaves 62 hours for other things.

212
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,049
You say you're working 60 hours.

213
00:09:47,073 --> 00:09:49,501
Well, that leaves 52 hours for other things.

214
00:09:49,525 --> 00:09:51,567
You say you're working more than 60 hours.

215
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,148
Well, are you sure?

216
00:09:53,172 --> 00:09:54,906
(Laughter)

217
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:57,836
There was once a study comparing people's estimated work weeks

218
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,255
with time diaries.

219
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:01,955
They found that people claiming 75-plus-hour work weeks

220
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:04,083
were off by about 25 hours.

221
00:10:04,107 --> 00:10:05,801
(Laughter)

222
00:10:05,825 --> 00:10:08,146
You can guess in which direction, right?

223
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:11,600
Anyway, in 168 hours a week,

224
00:10:11,624 --> 00:10:14,588
I think we can find time for what matters to you.

225
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:16,810
If you want to spend more time with your kids,

226
00:10:16,834 --> 00:10:19,139
you want to study more for a test you're taking,

227
00:10:19,163 --> 00:10:22,508
you want to exercise for three hours and volunteer for two,

228
00:10:22,532 --> 00:10:23,686
you can.

229
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:27,351
And that's even if you're working way more than full-time hours.

230
00:10:27,705 --> 00:10:29,757
So we have plenty of time, which is great,

231
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:31,007
because guess what?

232
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:33,869
We don't even need that much time to do amazing things.

233
00:10:34,306 --> 00:10:37,053
But when most of us have bits of time, what do we do?

234
00:10:37,528 --> 00:10:39,179
Pull out the phone, right?

235
00:10:39,646 --> 00:10:41,815
Start deleting emails.

236
00:10:42,201 --> 00:10:44,288
Otherwise, we're puttering around the house

237
00:10:44,312 --> 00:10:45,572
or watching TV.

238
00:10:45,934 --> 00:10:48,787
But small moments can have great power.

239
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:51,430
You can use your bits of time

240
00:10:51,914 --> 00:10:54,110
for bits of joy.

241
00:10:55,015 --> 00:10:57,884
Maybe it's choosing to read something wonderful on the bus

242
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,272
on the way to work.

243
00:10:59,296 --> 00:11:01,695
I know when I had a job that required two bus rides

244
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,264
and a subway ride every morning,

245
00:11:03,288 --> 00:11:06,191
I used to go to the library on weekends to get stuff to read.

246
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:10,706
It made the whole experience almost, almost, enjoyable.

247
00:11:11,677 --> 00:11:14,864
Breaks at work can be used for meditating or praying.

248
00:11:15,254 --> 00:11:18,448
If family dinner is out because of your crazy work schedule,

249
00:11:18,472 --> 00:11:21,221
maybe family breakfast could be a good substitute.

250
00:11:21,710 --> 00:11:24,840
It's about looking at the whole of one's time

251
00:11:24,864 --> 00:11:26,997
and seeing where the good stuff can go.

252
00:11:28,324 --> 00:11:30,037
I truly believe this.

253
00:11:30,874 --> 00:11:33,575
There is time.

254
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:36,453
Even if we are busy,

255
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:38,782
we have time for what matters.

256
00:11:39,572 --> 00:11:41,574
And when we focus on what matters,

257
00:11:42,132 --> 00:11:43,803
we can build the lives we want

258
00:11:44,585 --> 00:11:45,863
in the time we've got.

259
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,613
Thank you.

260
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:52,761
(Applause)
