1
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,881
So, I'll start with this: a couple years ago, an event planner called me

2
00:00:16,905 --> 00:00:18,954
because I was going to do a speaking event.

3
00:00:18,978 --> 00:00:20,668
And she called, and she said,

4
00:00:20,692 --> 00:00:24,264
"I'm really struggling with how to write about you on the little flyer."

5
00:00:24,288 --> 00:00:26,336
And I thought, "Well, what's the struggle?"

6
00:00:27,048 --> 00:00:28,952
And she said, "Well, I saw you speak,

7
00:00:28,976 --> 00:00:31,461
and I'm going to call you a researcher, I think,

8
00:00:31,485 --> 00:00:34,373
but I'm afraid if I call you a researcher, no one will come,

9
00:00:34,397 --> 00:00:36,856
because they'll think you're boring and irrelevant."

10
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,881
(Laughter)

11
00:00:37,905 --> 00:00:39,481
And I was like, "Okay."

12
00:00:39,505 --> 00:00:41,983
And she said, "But the thing I liked about your talk

13
00:00:42,007 --> 00:00:43,223
is you're a storyteller.

14
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:45,961
So I think what I'll do is just call you a storyteller."

15
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:49,526
And of course, the academic, insecure part of me

16
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,860
was like, "You're going to call me a what?"

17
00:00:51,884 --> 00:00:54,432
And she said, "I'm going to call you a storyteller."

18
00:00:54,456 --> 00:00:57,305
And I was like, "Why not 'magic pixie'?"

19
00:00:57,329 --> 00:00:59,808
(Laughter)

20
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:03,486
I was like, "Let me think about this for a second."

21
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:06,390
I tried to call deep on my courage.

22
00:01:06,414 --> 00:01:09,526
And I thought, you know, I am a storyteller.

23
00:01:09,550 --> 00:01:10,954
I'm a qualitative researcher.

24
00:01:10,978 --> 00:01:12,699
I collect stories; that's what I do.

25
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,121
And maybe stories are just data with a soul.

26
00:01:16,145 --> 00:01:18,526
And maybe I'm just a storyteller.

27
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:20,209
And so I said, "You know what?

28
00:01:20,233 --> 00:01:22,874
Why don't you just say I'm a researcher-storyteller."

29
00:01:22,898 --> 00:01:26,526
And she went, "Ha ha. There's no such thing."

30
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,233
(Laughter)

31
00:01:28,257 --> 00:01:32,234
So I'm a researcher-storyteller, and I'm going to talk to you today --

32
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,307
we're talking about expanding perception --

33
00:01:34,331 --> 00:01:36,713
and so I want to talk to you and tell some stories

34
00:01:36,737 --> 00:01:41,896
about a piece of my research that fundamentally expanded my perception

35
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,809
and really actually changed the way that I live and love

36
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:46,007
and work and parent.

37
00:01:46,653 --> 00:01:48,785
And this is where my story starts.

38
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:52,233
When I was a young researcher, doctoral student,

39
00:01:52,257 --> 00:01:56,234
my first year, I had a research professor who said to us,

40
00:01:56,258 --> 00:02:00,204
"Here's the thing, if you cannot measure it, it does not exist."

41
00:02:01,934 --> 00:02:04,526
And I thought he was just sweet-talking me.

42
00:02:04,899 --> 00:02:07,336
I was like, "Really?" and he was like, "Absolutely."

43
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:09,613
And so you have to understand

44
00:02:09,637 --> 00:02:12,217
that I have a bachelor's and a master's in social work,

45
00:02:12,241 --> 00:02:15,615
and I was getting my Ph.D. in social work, so my entire academic career

46
00:02:15,639 --> 00:02:21,256
was surrounded by people who kind of believed in the "life's messy, love it."

47
00:02:22,034 --> 00:02:27,462
And I'm more of the, "life's messy, clean it up, organize it

48
00:02:27,486 --> 00:02:29,263
and put it into a bento box."

49
00:02:29,287 --> 00:02:31,263
(Laughter)

50
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,891
And so to think that I had found my way, to found a career that takes me --

51
00:02:36,915 --> 00:02:40,248
really, one of the big sayings in social work is,

52
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:42,367
"Lean into the discomfort of the work."

53
00:02:43,097 --> 00:02:45,629
And I'm like, knock discomfort upside the head

54
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:47,931
and move it over and get all A's.

55
00:02:47,955 --> 00:02:49,867
That was my mantra.

56
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:53,526
So I was very excited about this.

57
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:56,526
And so I thought, you know what, this is the career for me,

58
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,526
because I am interested in some messy topics.

59
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,921
But I want to be able to make them not messy.

60
00:03:01,945 --> 00:03:03,267
I want to understand them.

61
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:06,868
I want to hack into these things that I know are important

62
00:03:06,892 --> 00:03:08,868
and lay the code out for everyone to see.

63
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:12,209
So where I started was with connection.

64
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:15,645
Because, by the time you're a social worker for 10 years,

65
00:03:15,669 --> 00:03:20,376
what you realize is that connection is why we're here.

66
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,780
It's what gives purpose and meaning to our lives.

67
00:03:23,636 --> 00:03:25,422
This is what it's all about.

68
00:03:25,446 --> 00:03:27,543
It doesn't matter whether you talk to people

69
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:30,659
who work in social justice, mental health and abuse and neglect,

70
00:03:30,683 --> 00:03:36,024
what we know is that connection, the ability to feel connected, is --

71
00:03:36,508 --> 00:03:38,526
neurobiologically that's how we're wired --

72
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,929
it's why we're here.

73
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:42,966
So I thought, you know what, I'm going to start with connection.

74
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:45,524
Well, you know that situation

75
00:03:45,548 --> 00:03:48,056
where you get an evaluation from your boss,

76
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,866
and she tells you 37 things that you do really awesome,

77
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,264
and one "opportunity for growth?"

78
00:03:53,288 --> 00:03:55,097
(Laughter)

79
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:59,224
And all you can think about is that opportunity for growth, right?

80
00:03:59,248 --> 00:04:01,946
Well, apparently this is the way my work went as well,

81
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:06,947
because, when you ask people about love, they tell you about heartbreak.

82
00:04:06,971 --> 00:04:09,605
When you ask people about belonging,

83
00:04:09,629 --> 00:04:13,581
they'll tell you their most excruciating experiences of being excluded.

84
00:04:13,605 --> 00:04:16,106
And when you ask people about connection,

85
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,668
the stories they told me were about disconnection.

86
00:04:19,678 --> 00:04:22,703
So very quickly -- really about six weeks into this research --

87
00:04:22,727 --> 00:04:28,749
I ran into this unnamed thing that absolutely unraveled connection

88
00:04:28,773 --> 00:04:31,233
in a way that I didn't understand or had never seen.

89
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:33,646
And so I pulled back out of the research

90
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:35,900
and thought, I need to figure out what this is.

91
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:38,103
And it turned out to be shame.

92
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:43,050
And shame is really easily understood as the fear of disconnection:

93
00:04:43,773 --> 00:04:48,329
Is there something about me that, if other people know it or see it,

94
00:04:48,353 --> 00:04:51,519
that I won't be worthy of connection?

95
00:04:52,153 --> 00:04:53,835
The things I can tell you about it:

96
00:04:53,859 --> 00:04:55,526
It's universal; we all have it.

97
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:57,550
The only people who don't experience shame

98
00:04:57,574 --> 00:04:59,908
have no capacity for human empathy or connection.

99
00:04:59,932 --> 00:05:01,526
No one wants to talk about it,

100
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:04,121
and the less you talk about it, the more you have it.

101
00:05:05,565 --> 00:05:10,731
What underpinned this shame, this "I'm not good enough," --

102
00:05:10,755 --> 00:05:12,359
which, we all know that feeling:

103
00:05:12,383 --> 00:05:14,432
"I'm not blank enough. I'm not thin enough,

104
00:05:14,456 --> 00:05:17,710
rich enough, beautiful enough, smart enough, promoted enough."

105
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:22,710
The thing that underpinned this was excruciating vulnerability.

106
00:05:23,422 --> 00:05:27,526
This idea of, in order for connection to happen,

107
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:31,296
we have to allow ourselves to be seen, really seen.

108
00:05:32,621 --> 00:05:35,819
And you know how I feel about vulnerability. I hate vulnerability.

109
00:05:35,843 --> 00:05:40,341
And so I thought, this is my chance to beat it back with my measuring stick.

110
00:05:40,365 --> 00:05:43,056
I'm going in, I'm going to figure this stuff out,

111
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,390
I'm going to spend a year, I'm going to totally deconstruct shame,

112
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:48,692
I'm going to understand how vulnerability works,

113
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:50,151
and I'm going to outsmart it.

114
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,470
So I was ready, and I was really excited.

115
00:05:56,799 --> 00:05:58,942
As you know, it's not going to turn out well.

116
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:01,479
(Laughter)

117
00:06:01,503 --> 00:06:03,097
You know this.

118
00:06:03,121 --> 00:06:05,010
So, I could tell you a lot about shame,

119
00:06:05,034 --> 00:06:07,131
but I'd have to borrow everyone else's time.

120
00:06:07,155 --> 00:06:10,012
But here's what I can tell you that it boils down to --

121
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:13,418
and this may be one of the most important things that I've ever learned

122
00:06:13,442 --> 00:06:15,306
in the decade of doing this research.

123
00:06:16,628 --> 00:06:20,820
My one year turned into six years:

124
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:25,526
Thousands of stories, hundreds of long interviews, focus groups.

125
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,931
At one point, people were sending me journal pages

126
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:29,792
and sending me their stories --

127
00:06:29,816 --> 00:06:33,808
thousands of pieces of data in six years.

128
00:06:33,832 --> 00:06:35,526
And I kind of got a handle on it.

129
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,649
I kind of understood, this is what shame is, this is how it works.

130
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:46,259
I wrote a book, I published a theory, but something was not okay --

131
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:50,439
and what it was is that, if I roughly took the people I interviewed

132
00:06:50,463 --> 00:06:57,035
and divided them into people who really have a sense of worthiness --

133
00:06:57,059 --> 00:06:59,821
that's what this comes down to, a sense of worthiness --

134
00:06:59,845 --> 00:07:03,067
they have a strong sense of love and belonging --

135
00:07:03,091 --> 00:07:04,742
and folks who struggle for it,

136
00:07:04,766 --> 00:07:07,866
and folks who are always wondering if they're good enough.

137
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,129
There was only one variable that separated

138
00:07:10,153 --> 00:07:12,893
the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging

139
00:07:12,917 --> 00:07:15,176
and the people who really struggle for it.

140
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,918
And that was, the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging

141
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:21,346
believe they're worthy of love and belonging.

142
00:07:22,264 --> 00:07:23,414
That's it.

143
00:07:24,065 --> 00:07:25,553
They believe they're worthy.

144
00:07:27,296 --> 00:07:33,114
And to me, the hard part of the one thing that keeps us out of connection

145
00:07:33,138 --> 00:07:36,353
is our fear that we're not worthy of connection,

146
00:07:36,377 --> 00:07:38,780
was something that, personally and professionally,

147
00:07:38,804 --> 00:07:41,026
I felt like I needed to understand better.

148
00:07:41,367 --> 00:07:46,344
So what I did is I took all of the interviews

149
00:07:46,368 --> 00:07:49,186
where I saw worthiness, where I saw people living that way,

150
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:51,098
and just looked at those.

151
00:07:51,874 --> 00:07:53,922
What do these people have in common?

152
00:07:53,946 --> 00:07:58,589
I have a slight office supply addiction, but that's another talk.

153
00:07:58,613 --> 00:08:02,090
So I had a manila folder, and I had a Sharpie,

154
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,734
and I was like, what am I going to call this research?

155
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:07,748
And the first words that came to my mind were "whole-hearted."

156
00:08:08,367 --> 00:08:11,883
These are whole-hearted people, living from this deep sense of worthiness.

157
00:08:11,907 --> 00:08:14,763
So I wrote at the top of the manila folder,

158
00:08:14,787 --> 00:08:16,716
and I started looking at the data.

159
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,733
In fact, I did it first in a four-day, very intensive data analysis,

160
00:08:22,757 --> 00:08:26,334
where I went back, pulled the interviews, the stories, pulled the incidents.

161
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:28,137
What's the theme? What's the pattern?

162
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,907
My husband left town with the kids

163
00:08:31,931 --> 00:08:34,908
because I always go into this Jackson Pollock crazy thing,

164
00:08:34,932 --> 00:08:38,677
where I'm just writing and in my researcher mode.

165
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:41,732
And so here's what I found.

166
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:47,526
What they had in common was a sense of courage.

167
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:51,281
And I want to separate courage and bravery for you for a minute.

168
00:08:51,305 --> 00:08:53,746
Courage, the original definition of courage,

169
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:56,009
when it first came into the English language --

170
00:08:56,033 --> 00:08:58,386
it's from the Latin word "cor," meaning "heart" --

171
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,421
and the original definition was to tell the story of who you are

172
00:09:01,445 --> 00:09:02,859
with your whole heart.

173
00:09:03,619 --> 00:09:07,793
And so these folks had, very simply, the courage to be imperfect.

174
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:15,169
They had the compassion to be kind to themselves first and then to others,

175
00:09:15,193 --> 00:09:16,392
because, as it turns out,

176
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,650
we can't practice compassion with other people

177
00:09:18,674 --> 00:09:20,417
if we can't treat ourselves kindly.

178
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:25,216
And the last was they had connection, and -- this was the hard part --

179
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:28,217
as a result of authenticity,

180
00:09:28,241 --> 00:09:31,526
they were willing to let go of who they thought they should be

181
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:36,154
in order to be who they were, which you have to absolutely do that

182
00:09:36,178 --> 00:09:37,351
for connection.

183
00:09:39,883 --> 00:09:43,883
The other thing that they had in common was this:

184
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:50,550
They fully embraced vulnerability.

185
00:09:52,239 --> 00:09:58,890
They believed that what made them vulnerable made them beautiful.

186
00:10:02,701 --> 00:10:06,526
They didn't talk about vulnerability being comfortable,

187
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:09,376
nor did they really talk about it being excruciating --

188
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,878
as I had heard it earlier in the shame interviewing.

189
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:14,132
They just talked about it being necessary.

190
00:10:15,193 --> 00:10:19,169
They talked about the willingness to say, "I love you" first ...

191
00:10:20,938 --> 00:10:26,311
the willingness to do something where there are no guarantees ...

192
00:10:27,843 --> 00:10:32,178
the willingness to breathe through waiting for the doctor to call

193
00:10:32,202 --> 00:10:33,485
after your mammogram.

194
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:38,456
They're willing to invest in a relationship

195
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,930
that may or may not work out.

196
00:10:41,025 --> 00:10:42,895
They thought this was fundamental.

197
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:46,621
I personally thought it was betrayal.

198
00:10:47,407 --> 00:10:52,003
I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research, where our job --

199
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:56,091
you know, the definition of research is to control and predict,

200
00:10:56,115 --> 00:11:00,758
to study phenomena for the explicit reason to control and predict.

201
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:05,148
And now my mission to control and predict

202
00:11:05,172 --> 00:11:08,741
had turned up the answer that the way to live is with vulnerability

203
00:11:08,765 --> 00:11:10,863
and to stop controlling and predicting.

204
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,664
This led to a little breakdown --

205
00:11:13,462 --> 00:11:18,526
(Laughter)

206
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:21,526
-- which actually looked more like this.

207
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,043
(Laughter)

208
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:25,044
And it did.

209
00:11:25,068 --> 00:11:28,248
I call it a breakdown; my therapist calls it a spiritual awakening.

210
00:11:28,272 --> 00:11:29,506
(Laughter)

211
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:31,947
A spiritual awakening sounds better than breakdown,

212
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:33,748
but I assure you, it was a breakdown.

213
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:36,676
And I had to put my data away and go find a therapist.

214
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,931
Let me tell you something: you know who you are

215
00:11:38,955 --> 00:11:42,195
when you call your friends and say, "I think I need to see somebody.

216
00:11:42,219 --> 00:11:44,025
Do you have any recommendations?"

217
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:46,098
Because about five of my friends were like,

218
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,266
"Wooo, I wouldn't want to be your therapist."

219
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:51,028
(Laughter)

220
00:11:51,052 --> 00:11:53,029
I was like, "What does that mean?"

221
00:11:53,053 --> 00:11:56,260
And they're like, "I'm just saying, you know.

222
00:11:56,284 --> 00:11:58,261
Don't bring your measuring stick."

223
00:11:58,285 --> 00:12:01,021
(Laughter)

224
00:12:01,045 --> 00:12:02,245
I was like, "Okay."

225
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:04,939
So I found a therapist.

226
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:06,866
My first meeting with her, Diana --

227
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:12,963
I brought in my list of the way the whole-hearted live, and I sat down.

228
00:12:12,987 --> 00:12:14,796
And she said, "How are you?"

229
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:18,415
And I said, "I'm great. I'm okay."

230
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:19,963
She said, "What's going on?"

231
00:12:19,987 --> 00:12:22,606
And this is a therapist who sees therapists,

232
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,843
because we have to go to those, because their B.S. meters are good.

233
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:29,843
(Laughter)

234
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:34,129
And so I said, "Here's the thing, I'm struggling."

235
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:35,963
And she said, "What's the struggle?"

236
00:12:37,002 --> 00:12:39,263
And I said, "Well, I have a vulnerability issue.

237
00:12:39,287 --> 00:12:44,642
And I know that vulnerability is the core of shame and fear

238
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,263
and our struggle for worthiness,

239
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:51,963
but it appears that it's also the birthplace of joy, of creativity,

240
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:53,963
of belonging, of love.

241
00:12:54,336 --> 00:12:59,772
And I think I have a problem, and I need some help."

242
00:12:59,796 --> 00:13:04,963
And I said, "But here's the thing: no family stuff, no childhood shit."

243
00:13:04,987 --> 00:13:06,963
(Laughter)

244
00:13:06,987 --> 00:13:09,963
"I just need some strategies."

245
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:13,963
(Laughter)

246
00:13:13,987 --> 00:13:17,572
(Applause)

247
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,158
Thank you.

248
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,320
So she goes like this.

249
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:26,343
(Laughter)

250
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:28,963
And then I said, "It's bad, right?"

251
00:13:28,987 --> 00:13:31,963
And she said, "It's neither good nor bad."

252
00:13:31,987 --> 00:13:33,820
(Laughter)

253
00:13:33,844 --> 00:13:35,478
"It just is what it is."

254
00:13:36,224 --> 00:13:38,963
And I said, "Oh my God, this is going to suck."

255
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:40,939
(Laughter)

256
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:44,407
And it did, and it didn't.

257
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:46,494
And it took about a year.

258
00:13:46,518 --> 00:13:48,534
And you know how there are people

259
00:13:48,558 --> 00:13:52,582
that, when they realize that vulnerability and tenderness are important,

260
00:13:52,606 --> 00:13:54,637
that they surrender and walk into it.

261
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,751
A: that's not me,

262
00:13:57,775 --> 00:14:00,172
and B: I don't even hang out with people like that.

263
00:14:00,196 --> 00:14:02,963
(Laughter)

264
00:14:02,987 --> 00:14:05,074
For me, it was a yearlong street fight.

265
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:07,486
It was a slugfest.

266
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:09,733
Vulnerability pushed, I pushed back.

267
00:14:10,153 --> 00:14:13,240
I lost the fight,

268
00:14:13,264 --> 00:14:14,963
but probably won my life back.

269
00:14:15,287 --> 00:14:17,263
And so then I went back into the research

270
00:14:17,287 --> 00:14:18,963
and spent the next couple of years

271
00:14:18,987 --> 00:14:21,963
really trying to understand what they, the whole-hearted,

272
00:14:21,987 --> 00:14:27,963
what choices they were making, and what we are doing with vulnerability.

273
00:14:27,987 --> 00:14:30,327
Why do we struggle with it so much?

274
00:14:30,351 --> 00:14:32,512
Am I alone in struggling with vulnerability?

275
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:34,963
No.

276
00:14:34,987 --> 00:14:36,448
So this is what I learned.

277
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,186
We numb vulnerability --

278
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:42,827
when we're waiting for the call.

279
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:45,740
It was funny, I sent something out on Twitter and on Facebook

280
00:14:45,764 --> 00:14:48,038
that says, "How would you define vulnerability?

281
00:14:48,062 --> 00:14:49,610
What makes you feel vulnerable?"

282
00:14:49,634 --> 00:14:52,358
And within an hour and a half, I had 150 responses.

283
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:55,355
Because I wanted to know what's out there.

284
00:14:57,764 --> 00:15:02,787
Having to ask my husband for help because I'm sick, and we're newly married;

285
00:15:02,811 --> 00:15:04,818
initiating sex with my husband;

286
00:15:04,842 --> 00:15:07,556
initiating sex with my wife;

287
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:10,558
being turned down; asking someone out;

288
00:15:10,582 --> 00:15:12,621
waiting for the doctor to call back;

289
00:15:12,645 --> 00:15:14,987
getting laid off; laying off people.

290
00:15:15,011 --> 00:15:16,415
This is the world we live in.

291
00:15:17,522 --> 00:15:20,490
We live in a vulnerable world.

292
00:15:20,514 --> 00:15:23,450
And one of the ways we deal with it is we numb vulnerability.

293
00:15:24,248 --> 00:15:25,963
And I think there's evidence --

294
00:15:25,987 --> 00:15:28,368
and it's not the only reason this evidence exists,

295
00:15:28,392 --> 00:15:30,501
but I think it's a huge cause --

296
00:15:30,525 --> 00:15:33,414
We are the most in-debt ...

297
00:15:35,098 --> 00:15:36,320
obese ...

298
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,629
addicted and medicated adult cohort in U.S. history.

299
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:48,145
The problem is -- and I learned this from the research --

300
00:15:48,169 --> 00:15:51,312
that you cannot selectively numb emotion.

301
00:15:51,851 --> 00:15:54,184
You can't say, here's the bad stuff.

302
00:15:54,987 --> 00:15:57,363
Here's vulnerability, here's grief, here's shame,

303
00:15:57,387 --> 00:15:59,063
here's fear, here's disappointment.

304
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:00,963
I don't want to feel these.

305
00:16:00,987 --> 00:16:03,869
I'm going to have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.

306
00:16:03,893 --> 00:16:06,579
(Laughter)

307
00:16:06,603 --> 00:16:08,472
I don't want to feel these.

308
00:16:08,496 --> 00:16:10,472
And I know that's knowing laughter.

309
00:16:10,496 --> 00:16:12,963
I hack into your lives for a living.

310
00:16:12,987 --> 00:16:14,963
God.

311
00:16:14,987 --> 00:16:17,534
(Laughter)

312
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:20,316
You can't numb those hard feelings

313
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,974
without numbing the other affects, our emotions.

314
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,450
You cannot selectively numb.

315
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:27,081
So when we numb those,

316
00:16:27,105 --> 00:16:29,628
we numb joy,

317
00:16:29,652 --> 00:16:30,963
we numb gratitude,

318
00:16:30,987 --> 00:16:32,287
we numb happiness.

319
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:36,831
And then, we are miserable,

320
00:16:36,855 --> 00:16:38,864
and we are looking for purpose and meaning,

321
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:40,320
and then we feel vulnerable,

322
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:43,152
so then we have a couple of beers and a banana nut muffin.

323
00:16:43,176 --> 00:16:46,542
And it becomes this dangerous cycle.

324
00:16:47,647 --> 00:16:50,780
One of the things that I think we need to think about

325
00:16:50,804 --> 00:16:52,780
is why and how we numb.

326
00:16:53,488 --> 00:16:55,568
And it doesn't just have to be addiction.

327
00:16:57,037 --> 00:17:00,410
The other thing we do is we make everything that's uncertain certain.

328
00:17:01,987 --> 00:17:07,073
Religion has gone from a belief in faith and mystery to certainty.

329
00:17:07,097 --> 00:17:08,779
"I'm right, you're wrong. Shut up."

330
00:17:10,747 --> 00:17:11,963
That's it.

331
00:17:13,171 --> 00:17:14,441
Just certain.

332
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:17,316
The more afraid we are, the more vulnerable we are,

333
00:17:17,340 --> 00:17:18,725
the more afraid we are.

334
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:20,756
This is what politics looks like today.

335
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,455
There's no discourse anymore.

336
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:23,963
There's no conversation.

337
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:25,591
There's just blame.

338
00:17:25,615 --> 00:17:27,932
You know how blame is described in the research?

339
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:31,612
A way to discharge pain and discomfort.

340
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:35,366
We perfect.

341
00:17:35,390 --> 00:17:39,168
If there's anyone who wants their life to look like this, it would be me,

342
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:40,419
but it doesn't work.

343
00:17:40,443 --> 00:17:44,063
Because what we do is we take fat from our butts and put it in our cheeks.

344
00:17:44,087 --> 00:17:47,526
(Laughter)

345
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:50,963
Which just, I hope in 100 years, people will look back and go, "Wow."

346
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,510
(Laughter)

347
00:17:53,534 --> 00:17:56,963
And we perfect, most dangerously, our children.

348
00:17:56,987 --> 00:17:59,130
Let me tell you what we think about children.

349
00:17:59,154 --> 00:18:01,963
They're hardwired for struggle when they get here.

350
00:18:01,987 --> 00:18:04,869
And when you hold those perfect little babies in your hand,

351
00:18:04,893 --> 00:18:07,851
our job is not to say, "Look at her, she's perfect.

352
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:09,771
My job is just to keep her perfect --

353
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:13,202
make sure she makes the tennis team by fifth grade and Yale by seventh."

354
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,463
That's not our job.

355
00:18:14,487 --> 00:18:16,096
Our job is to look and say,

356
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:19,136
"You know what? You're imperfect, and you're wired for struggle,

357
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,160
but you are worthy of love and belonging."

358
00:18:22,061 --> 00:18:23,248
That's our job.

359
00:18:23,664 --> 00:18:25,894
Show me a generation of kids raised like that,

360
00:18:25,918 --> 00:18:28,519
and we'll end the problems, I think, that we see today.

361
00:18:28,543 --> 00:18:33,995
We pretend that what we do doesn't have an effect on people.

362
00:18:35,431 --> 00:18:37,065
We do that in our personal lives.

363
00:18:37,089 --> 00:18:38,312
We do that corporate --

364
00:18:38,336 --> 00:18:40,446
whether it's a bailout, an oil spill ...

365
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:43,106
a recall.

366
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,107
We pretend like what we're doing

367
00:18:45,131 --> 00:18:47,217
doesn't have a huge impact on other people.

368
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:51,261
I would say to companies, this is not our first rodeo, people.

369
00:18:52,329 --> 00:18:54,996
We just need you to be authentic and real and say ...

370
00:18:56,479 --> 00:18:58,623
"We're sorry. We'll fix it."

371
00:19:02,095 --> 00:19:04,867
But there's another way, and I'll leave you with this.

372
00:19:04,891 --> 00:19:06,272
This is what I have found:

373
00:19:06,296 --> 00:19:10,819
To let ourselves be seen, deeply seen, vulnerably seen ...

374
00:19:13,451 --> 00:19:17,840
to love with our whole hearts, even though there's no guarantee --

375
00:19:17,864 --> 00:19:19,118
and that's really hard,

376
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:22,483
and I can tell you as a parent, that's excruciatingly difficult --

377
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:29,237
to practice gratitude and joy in those moments of terror,

378
00:19:29,261 --> 00:19:31,574
when we're wondering, "Can I love you this much?

379
00:19:31,598 --> 00:19:33,784
Can I believe in this this passionately?

380
00:19:33,808 --> 00:19:35,738
Can I be this fierce about this?"

381
00:19:35,762 --> 00:19:39,339
just to be able to stop and, instead of catastrophizing what might happen,

382
00:19:39,363 --> 00:19:41,340
to say, "I'm just so grateful,

383
00:19:41,364 --> 00:19:43,764
because to feel this vulnerable means I'm alive."

384
00:19:45,308 --> 00:19:48,970
And the last, which I think is probably the most important,

385
00:19:48,994 --> 00:19:50,644
is to believe that we're enough.

386
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:55,073
Because when we work from a place, I believe, that says, "I'm enough" ...

387
00:19:57,303 --> 00:20:01,271
then we stop screaming and start listening,

388
00:20:01,295 --> 00:20:03,622
we're kinder and gentler to the people around us,

389
00:20:03,646 --> 00:20:05,795
and we're kinder and gentler to ourselves.

390
00:20:06,685 --> 00:20:08,163
That's all I have. Thank you.

391
00:20:08,187 --> 00:20:10,780
(Applause)
