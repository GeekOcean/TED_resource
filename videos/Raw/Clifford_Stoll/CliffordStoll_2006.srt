1
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,820
I'm delighted to be here.

2
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:16,820
I'm honored by the invitation, and thanks.

3
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,820
I would love to talk about stuff that I'm interested in,

4
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,820
but unfortunately, I suspect that what I'm interested in

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,820
won't interest many other people.

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:26,820
First off, my badge says I'm an astronomer.

7
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,820
I would love to talk about my astronomy,

8
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:31,820
but I suspect that the number of people who are interested in radiative transfer

9
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:33,820
in non-gray atmospheres

10
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,820
and polarization of light in Jupiter's upper atmosphere

11
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,820
are the number of people who'd fit in a bus shelter.

12
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:39,820
So I'm not going to talk about that.

13
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
(Laughter)

14
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,820
It would be just as much fun

15
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:46,820
to talk about some stuff that happened in 1986 and 1987,

16
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,820
when a computer hacker is breaking into our systems

17
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,820
over at Lawrence Berkeley Labs.

18
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:53,820
And I caught the guys,

19
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:57,820
and they turned out to be working for what was then the Soviet KGB,

20
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,820
and stealing information and selling it.

21
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,820
And I'd love to talk about that -- and it'd be fun --

22
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:06,820
but, 20 years later ...

23
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:08,820
I find computer security, frankly, to be kind of boring.

24
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:10,820
It's tedious.

25
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:11,820
I'm --

26
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,820
The first time you do something, it's science.

27
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:18,820
The second time, it's engineering.

28
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,820
A third time, it's just being a technician.

29
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:24,820
I'm a scientist. Once I do something, I do something else.

30
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,820
So, I'm not going to talk about that.

31
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,820
Nor am I going to talk about what I think are obvious statements from my first book,

32
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,820
"Silicon Snake Oil," or my second book,

33
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,820
nor am I going to talk about

34
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,820
why I believe computers don't belong in schools.

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:46,820
I feel that there's a massive and bizarre idea going around

36
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,820
that we have to bring more computers into schools.

37
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,820
My idea is: no! No!

38
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:56,820
Get them out of schools, and keep them out of schools.

39
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,820
And I'd love to talk about this,

40
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:03,820
but I think the argument is so obvious to anyone who's hung around a fourth grade classroom

41
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,820
that it doesn't need much talking about --

42
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,820
but I guess I may be very wrong about that,

43
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:10,820
and everything else that I've said.

44
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,820
So don't go back and read my dissertation.

45
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,820
It probably has lies in it as well.

46
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:18,820
Having said that, I outlined my talk about five minutes ago.

47
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,820
(Laughter)

48
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:23,820
And if you look at it over here,

49
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:26,820
the main thing I wrote on my thumb was the future.

50
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:29,820
I'm supposed to talk about the future, yes?

51
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:36,820
Oh, right. And my feeling is, asking me to talk about the future is bizarre,

52
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,820
because I've got gray hair,

53
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:44,820
and so, it's kind of silly for me to talk about the future.

54
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:48,820
In fact, I think that if you really want to know what the future's going to be,

55
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,820
if you really want to know about the future,

56
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:54,820
don't ask a technologist, a scientist, a physicist.

57
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:58,820
No! Don't ask somebody who's writing code.

58
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:06,820
No, if you want to know what society's going to be like in 20 years,

59
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,820
ask a kindergarten teacher.

60
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,820
They know.

61
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:14,820
In fact, don't ask just any kindergarten teacher,

62
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:16,820
ask an experienced one.

63
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:20,820
They're the ones who know what society is going to be like in another generation.

64
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,820
I don't. Nor, I suspect,

65
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,820
do many other people who are talking about what the future will bring.

66
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:29,820
Certainly, all of us can imagine these cool new things

67
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,820
that are going to be there.

68
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:34,820
But to me, things aren't the future.

69
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,820
What I ask myself is, what's society is going to be like,

70
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:43,820
when the kids today are phenomenally good at text messaging

71
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,820
and spend a huge amount of on-screen time,

72
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:51,820
but have never gone bowling together?

73
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,820
Change is happening, and the change that is happening

74
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:57,820
is not one that is in software.

75
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,820
But that's not what I'm going to talk about.

76
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,820
I'd love to talk about it, it'd be fun,

77
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,820
but I want to talk about what I'm doing now. What am I doing now?

78
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,820
Oh -- the other thing that I think I'd like to talk about

79
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,820
is right over here. Right over here.

80
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:17,820
Is that visible? What I'd like to talk about is one-sided things.

81
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,820
I would dearly love to talk about

82
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:22,820
things that have one side.

83
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,820
Because I love Mobius loops. I not only love Mobius loops,

84
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,820
but I'm one of the very few people,

85
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,820
if not the only person in the world, that makes Klein bottles.

86
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,820
Right away, I hope that all of your eyes glaze over.

87
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:38,820
This is a Klein bottle.

88
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,820
For those of you in the audience who know,

89
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,820
you roll your eyes and say, yup, I know all about it.

90
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:45,820
It's one sided. It's a bottle whose inside is its outside.

91
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,820
It has zero volume. And it's non-orientable.

92
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,820
It has wonderful properties.

93
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:52,820
If you take two Mobius loops and sew their common edge together,

94
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:55,820
you get one of these, and I make them out of glass.

95
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:57,820
And I'd love to talk to you about this,

96
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:01,820
but I don't have much in the way of ... things to say because --

97
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,820
(Laughter)

98
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:06,820
(Chris Anderson: I've got a cold.)

99
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:13,820
However, the "D" in TED of course stands for design.

100
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:15,820
Just two weeks ago I made --

101
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:21,820
you know, I've been making small, medium and big Klein bottles for the trade.

102
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,820
But what I've just made --

103
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,820
and I'm delighted to show you, first time in public here.

104
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:39,820
This is a Klein bottle wine bottle,

105
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:42,820
which, although in four dimensions

106
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,820
it shouldn't be able to hold any fluid at all,

107
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,820
it's perfectly capable of doing so

108
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,820
because our universe has only three spatial dimensions.

109
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,820
And because our universe is only three spatial dimensions,

110
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,820
it can hold fluids.

111
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:00,820
So it's highly -- that one's the cool one.

112
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:05,820
That was a month of my life.

113
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,820
But although I would love to talk about topology with you, I'm not going to.

114
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:16,820
(Laughter)

115
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:21,820
Instead, I'm going to mention my mom,

116
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,820
who passed away last summer.

117
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,820
Had collected photographs of me, as mothers will do.

118
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,820
Could somebody put this guy up?

119
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:33,820
And I looked over her album

120
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,820
and she had collected a picture of me, standing --

121
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:40,820
well, sitting -- in 1969, in front of a bunch of dials.

122
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:44,820
And I looked at it, and said, oh my god,

123
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,820
that was me, when I was working at the electronic music studio!

124
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,820
As a technician, repairing and maintaining

125
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:54,820
the electronic music studio at SUNY Buffalo. And wow!

126
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,820
Way back machine. And I said to myself, oh yeah!

127
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,820
And it sent me back.

128
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:11,820
Soon after that, I found in another picture that she had, a picture of me.

129
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,820
This guy over here of course is me.

130
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
This man is Robert Moog,

131
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,820
the inventor of the Moog synthesizer,

132
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:24,820
who passed away this past August.

133
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Robert Moog was a generous, kind person, extraordinarily competent engineer.

134
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,820
A musician who took time from his life to teach me,

135
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,820
a sophomore, a freshman at SUNY Buffalo.

136
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,820
He'd come up from Trumansburg to teach me

137
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,820
not just about the Moog synthesizer, but we'd be sitting there --

138
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,820
I'm studying physics at the time. This is 1969, 70, 71.

139
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,820
We're studying physics, I'm studying physics,

140
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,820
and he's saying, "That's a good thing to do.

141
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,820
Don't get caught up in electronic music if you're doing physics."

142
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,820
Mentoring me. He'd come up and

143
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:04,820
spend hours and hours with me.

144
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:07,820
He wrote a letter of recommendation for me to get into graduate school.

145
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,820
In the background, my bicycle.

146
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:12,820
I realize that this picture was taken at a friend's living room.

147
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:15,820
Bob Moog came by and hauled a whole pile of equipment

148
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,820
to show Greg Flint and I things about this.

149
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:19,820
We sat around talking about Fourier transforms,

150
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:22,820
Bessel functions, modulation transfer functions,

151
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:25,820
stuff like this.

152
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:30,820
Bob's passing this past summer has been a loss to all of us.

153
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,820
Anyone who's a musician has been profoundly influenced by Robert Moog.

154
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,820
(Applause)

155
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:42,820
And I'll just say what I'm about to do. What I'm about to do --

156
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:46,820
I hope you can recognize that there's a distorted sine wave,

157
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,820
almost a triangular wave upon this Hewlett-Packard oscilloscope.

158
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,820
Oh, cool. I can get to this place over here, right?

159
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,820
Kids. Kids is what I'm going to talk about -- is that okay?

160
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:03,820
It says kids over here, that's what I'd like to talk about.

161
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:07,820
I've decided that, for me at least,

162
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,820
I don't have a big enough head.

163
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,820
So I think locally and I act locally.

164
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:19,820
I feel that the best way I can help out anything is to help out very, very locally.

165
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:24,820
So Ph.D. this, and degree there, and the yadda yadda.

166
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:28,820
I was talking about this stuff to

167
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,820
some schoolteachers about a year ago.

168
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,820
And one of them, several of them would come up to me and say,

169
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,820
"Well, how come you ain't teaching?"

170
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:35,820
And I said, "Well, I've taught graduate --

171
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,820
I've had graduate students, I've taught undergraduate classes."

172
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,820
No, they said, "If you're so into kids and all this stuff,

173
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:43,820
how come you ain't over here on the front lines?

174
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:47,820
Put your money where you mouth is."

175
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:53,820
Is true. Is true. I teach eighth-grade science four days a week.

176
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:55,820
Not just showing up every now and then.

177
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,820
No, no, no, no, no. I take attendance.

178
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,820
I take lunch hour. (Applause)

179
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,820
This is not -- no, no, no, this is not claps.

180
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:09,820
I strongly suggest that this is a good thing for each of you to do.

181
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,820
Not just show up to class every now and then.

182
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,820
Teach a solid week. Okay, I'm teaching three-quarters time, but good enough.

183
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,820
One of the things that I've done for my science students

184
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:20,820
is to tell them, "Look, I'm going to teach you college-level physics.

185
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,820
No calculus, I'll cut out that.

186
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
You won't need to know trig.

187
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,820
But you will need to know eighth-grade algebra,

188
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,820
and we're going to do serious experiments.

189
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,820
None of this open-to-chapter-seven-and-do-all-the-odd-problem-sets.

190
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,820
We're going to be doing genuine physics."

191
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,820
And that's one of the things I thought I'd do right now.

192
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:40,820
(High-pitched tone)

193
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,820
Oh, before I even turn that on,

194
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,820
one of the things that we did about three weeks ago in my class --

195
00:10:46,820 --> 00:10:48,820
this is through the lens, and one of the things we used a lens for

196
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,820
was to measure the speed of light.

197
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:53,820
My students in El Cerrito -- with my help, of course,

198
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,820
and with the help of a very beat up oscilloscope --

199
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,820
measured the speed of light.

200
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:02,820
We were off by 25 percent. How many eighth graders do you know of

201
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
who have measured the speed of light?

202
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:07,820
In addition to that, we've measured the speed of sound.

203
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,820
I'd love to measure the speed of light here.

204
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,820
I was all set to do it and I was thinking, "Aw man,"

205
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,820
I was just going to impose upon the powers that be,

206
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,820
and measure the speed of light.

207
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,820
And I'm all set to do it. I'm all set to do it,

208
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:23,820
but then it turns out that to set up here, you have like 10 minutes to set up!

209
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,820
And there's no time to do it.

210
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:27,820
So, next time, maybe, I'll measure the speed of light!

211
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,820
But meanwhile, let's measure the speed of sound!

212
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,820
Well, the obvious way to measure the speed of sound

213
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,820
is to bounce sound off something and look at the echo.

214
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:39,820
But, probably -- one of my students, Ariel [unclear], said,

215
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:42,820
"Could we measure the speed of light using the wave equation?"

216
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:44,820
And all of you know the wave equation is

217
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:50,820
the frequency times the wavelength of any wave ...

218
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,820
is a constant. When the frequency goes up,

219
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,820
the wavelength comes down. Wavelength goes up,

220
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,820
frequency goes down. So, if we have a wave here --

221
00:12:01,820 --> 00:12:05,820
over here, that's what's interesting --

222
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,820
as the pitch goes up, things get closer,

223
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,820
pitch goes down, things stretch out.

224
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,820
Right? This is simple physics.

225
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:17,820
All of you know this from eighth grade, remember?

226
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,820
What they didn't tell you in physics -- in eighth-grade physics --

227
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
but they should have, and I wish they had,

228
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:28,820
was that if you multiply the frequency times the wavelength of sound

229
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,820
or light, you get a constant.

230
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:34,820
And that constant is the speed of sound.

231
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,820
So, in order to measure the speed of sound,

232
00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:42,820
all I've got to do is know its frequency. Well, that's easy.

233
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:44,820
I've got a frequency counter right here.

234
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,820
Set it up to around A, above A, above A. There's an A, more or less.

235
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,820
Now, so I know the frequency.

236
00:12:54,820 --> 00:12:58,820
It's 1.76 kilohertz. I measure its wavelength.

237
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:02,820
All I need now is to flip on another beam,

238
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:05,820
and the bottom beam is me talking, right?

239
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,820
So anytime I talk, you'd see it on the screen.

240
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:14,820
I'll put it over here, and as I move this away from the source,

241
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:18,820
you'll notice the spiral.

242
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:24,820
The slinky moves. We're going through different nodes of the wave,

243
00:13:24,820 --> 00:13:26,820
coming out this way.

244
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,820
Those of you who are physicists, I hear you rolling your eyes,

245
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,820
but bear with me. (Laughter)

246
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:33,820
To measure the wavelength,

247
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:38,820
all I need to do is measure the distance from here --

248
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,820
one full wave -- over to here.

249
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:44,820
From here to here is the wavelength of sound.

250
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:51,820
So, I'll put a measuring tape here, measuring tape here, move it back over to here.

251
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:56,820
I've moved the microphone 20 centimeters.

252
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:01,820
0.2 meters from here, back to here, 20 centimeters.

253
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:08,820
OK, let's go back to Mr. Elmo.

254
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:15,820
And we'll say the frequency is 1.76 kilohertz, or 1760.

255
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:20,820
The wavelength was 0.2 meters.

256
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,820
Let's figure out what this is.

257
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:31,820
(Laughter) (Applause)

258
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:39,820
1.76 times 0.2 over here is 352 meters per second.

259
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:45,820
If you look it up in the book, it's really 343.

260
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:47,820
But, here with kludgy material, and lousy drink --

261
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,820
we've been able to measure the speed of sound to --

262
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,820
not bad. Pretty good.

263
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:58,820
All of which comes to what I wanted to say.

264
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:04,820
Go back to this picture of me a million years ago.

265
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:09,820
It was 1971, the Vietnam War was going on,

266
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:12,820
and I'm like, "Oh my God!"

267
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,820
I'm studying physics: Landau, Lipschitz, Resnick and Halliday.

268
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,820
I'm going home for a midterm. A riot's going on on campus.

269
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:26,820
There's a riot! Hey, Elmo's done: off.

270
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:28,820
There's a riot going on on campus,

271
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:31,820
and the police are chasing me, right?

272
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:34,820
I'm walking across campus. Cop comes and looks at me and says,

273
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,820
"You! You're a student."

274
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:38,820
Pulls out a gun. Goes boom!

275
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,820
And a tear gas canister the size of a Pepsi can goes by my head. Whoosh!

276
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,820
I get a breath of tear gas and I can't breathe.

277
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,820
This cop comes after me with a rifle.

278
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,820
He wants to clunk me over the head!

279
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:52,820
I'm saying, "I got to clear out of here!"

280
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,820
I go running across campus quick as I can. I duck into Hayes Hall.

281
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:00,820
It's one of these bell-tower buildings.

282
00:16:00,820 --> 00:16:01,820
The cop's chasing me.

283
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:04,820
Chasing me up the first floor, second floor, third floor.

284
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,820
Chases me into this room.

285
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,820
The entranceway to the bell tower.

286
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,820
I slam the door behind me, climb up,

287
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,820
go past this place where I see a pendulum ticking.

288
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,820
And I'm thinking, "Oh yeah,

289
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,820
the square root of the length is proportional to its period." (Laughter)

290
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,820
I keep climbing up, go back.

291
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,820
I go to a place where a dowel splits off.

292
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:21,820
There's a clock, clock, clock, clock.

293
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,820
The time's going backwards because I'm inside of it.

294
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:27,820
I'm thinking of Lorenz contractions and Einsteinian relativity.

295
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:30,820
I climb up, and there's this place, way in the back,

296
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,820
that you climb up this wooden ladder.

297
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:34,820
I pop up the top, and there's a cupola.

298
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,820
A dome, one of these ten-foot domes.

299
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:39,820
I'm looking out and I'm seeing the cops bashing students' heads,

300
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,820
shooting tear gas, and watching students throwing bricks.

301
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,820
And I'm asking, "What am I doing here? Why am I here?"

302
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,820
Then I remember what my English teacher in high school said.

303
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:51,820
Namely, that when they cast bells,

304
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,820
they write inscriptions on them.

305
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:58,820
So, I wipe the pigeon manure off one of the bells, and I look at it.

306
00:16:58,820 --> 00:16:59,820
I'm asking myself, "Why am I here?"

307
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:05,820
So, at this time, I'd like to tell you the words inscribed

308
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:09,820
upon the Hayes Hall tower bells:

309
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:14,820
"All truth is one.

310
00:17:14,820 --> 00:17:20,820
In this light, may science and religion endeavor here

311
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:24,820
for the steady evolution of mankind, from darkness to light,

312
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:29,820
from narrowness to broad-mindedness, from prejudice to tolerance.

313
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:39,820
It is the voice of life, which calls us to come and learn."

314
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:42,820
Thank you very much.
