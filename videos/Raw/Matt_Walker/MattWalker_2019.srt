1
00:00:12,665 --> 00:00:14,170
Thank you very much.

2
00:00:14,194 --> 00:00:18,193
Well, I would like to start with testicles.

3
00:00:18,503 --> 00:00:20,113
(Laughter)

4
00:00:21,018 --> 00:00:23,772
Men who sleep five hours a night

5
00:00:23,796 --> 00:00:29,049
have significantly smaller testicles than those who sleep seven hours or more.

6
00:00:29,073 --> 00:00:31,874
(Laughter)

7
00:00:31,898 --> 00:00:36,977
In addition, men who routinely sleep just four to five hours a night

8
00:00:37,001 --> 00:00:39,517
will have a level of testosterone

9
00:00:39,541 --> 00:00:42,874
which is that of someone 10 years their senior.

10
00:00:44,903 --> 00:00:48,664
So a lack of sleep will age a man by a decade

11
00:00:48,688 --> 00:00:51,473
in terms of that critical aspect of wellness.

12
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:58,183
And we see equivalent impairments in female reproductive health

13
00:00:58,207 --> 00:00:59,624
caused by a lack of sleep.

14
00:01:02,906 --> 00:01:05,557
This is the best news that I have for you today.

15
00:01:05,581 --> 00:01:08,257
(Laughter)

16
00:01:08,281 --> 00:01:10,658
From this point, it may only get worse.

17
00:01:10,682 --> 00:01:13,462
Not only will I tell you about the wonderfully good things

18
00:01:13,486 --> 00:01:15,321
that happen when you get sleep,

19
00:01:15,345 --> 00:01:19,826
but the alarmingly bad things that happen when you don't get enough,

20
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,381
both for your brain and for your body.

21
00:01:23,214 --> 00:01:25,628
Let me start with the brain

22
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,657
and the functions of learning and memory,

23
00:01:28,681 --> 00:01:31,950
because what we've discovered over the past 10 or so years

24
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:34,871
is that you need sleep after learning

25
00:01:34,895 --> 00:01:38,182
to essentially hit the save button on those new memories

26
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:39,506
so that you don't forget.

27
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:46,284
But recently, we discovered that you also need sleep before learning

28
00:01:46,308 --> 00:01:49,379
to actually prepare your brain,

29
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:51,459
almost like a dry sponge

30
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:53,926
ready to initially soak up new information.

31
00:01:54,987 --> 00:01:58,099
And without sleep, the memory circuits of the brain

32
00:01:58,123 --> 00:02:00,894
essentially become waterlogged, as it were,

33
00:02:00,918 --> 00:02:03,075
and you can't absorb new memories.

34
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,888
So let me show you the data.

35
00:02:05,912 --> 00:02:10,165
Here in this study, we decided to test the hypothesis

36
00:02:10,189 --> 00:02:12,737
that pulling the all-nighter was a good idea.

37
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:16,423
So we took a group of individuals

38
00:02:16,447 --> 00:02:19,994
and we assigned them to one of two experimental groups:

39
00:02:20,018 --> 00:02:23,475
a sleep group and a sleep deprivation group.

40
00:02:23,499 --> 00:02:28,119
Now the sleep group, they're going to get a full eight hours of slumber,

41
00:02:28,143 --> 00:02:30,811
but the deprivation group, we're going to keep them awake

42
00:02:30,835 --> 00:02:32,985
in the laboratory, under full supervision.

43
00:02:33,478 --> 00:02:37,858
There's no naps or caffeine, by the way, so it's miserable for everyone involved.

44
00:02:38,406 --> 00:02:39,935
And then the next day,

45
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,259
we're going to place those participants inside an MRI scanner

46
00:02:44,283 --> 00:02:48,069
and we're going to have them try and learn a whole list of new facts

47
00:02:48,093 --> 00:02:51,392
as we're taking snapshots of brain activity.

48
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:53,395
And then we're going to test them

49
00:02:53,419 --> 00:02:55,903
to see how effective that learning has been.

50
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:59,704
And that's what you're looking at here on the vertical axis.

51
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:03,015
And when you put those two groups head to head,

52
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:08,078
what you find is a quite significant, 40-percent deficit

53
00:03:08,102 --> 00:03:11,578
in the ability of the brain to make new memories without sleep.

54
00:03:12,864 --> 00:03:14,714
I think this should be concerning,

55
00:03:14,738 --> 00:03:16,960
considering what we know is happening to sleep

56
00:03:16,984 --> 00:03:19,403
in our education populations right now.

57
00:03:20,358 --> 00:03:22,177
In fact, to put that in context,

58
00:03:22,201 --> 00:03:25,698
it would be the difference in a child acing an exam

59
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:28,622
versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent.

60
00:03:30,114 --> 00:03:34,310
And we've gone on to discover what goes wrong within your brain

61
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:37,455
to produce these types of learning disabilities.

62
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:40,153
And there's a structure that sits

63
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:44,809
on the left and the right side of your brain, called the hippocampus.

64
00:03:44,833 --> 00:03:46,618
And you can think of the hippocampus

65
00:03:46,642 --> 00:03:49,879
almost like the informational inbox of your brain.

66
00:03:50,454 --> 00:03:53,645
It's very good at receiving new memory files

67
00:03:53,669 --> 00:03:55,144
and then holding on to them.

68
00:03:56,751 --> 00:03:58,462
And when you look at this structure

69
00:03:58,486 --> 00:04:01,548
in those people who'd had a full night of sleep,

70
00:04:01,572 --> 00:04:05,097
we saw lots of healthy learning-related activity.

71
00:04:06,464 --> 00:04:09,423
Yet in those people who were sleep-deprived,

72
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:13,073
we actually couldn't find any significant signal whatsoever.

73
00:04:14,552 --> 00:04:19,533
So it's almost as though sleep deprivation had shut down your memory inbox,

74
00:04:19,557 --> 00:04:22,533
and any new incoming files -- they were just being bounced.

75
00:04:23,718 --> 00:04:27,326
You couldn't effectively commit new experiences to memory.

76
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:34,381
So that's the bad that can happen if I were to take sleep away from you,

77
00:04:34,405 --> 00:04:37,477
but let me just come back to that control group for a second.

78
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:41,596
Do you remember those folks that got a full eight hours of sleep?

79
00:04:42,238 --> 00:04:44,714
Well, we can ask a very different question:

80
00:04:44,738 --> 00:04:48,342
What is it about the physiological quality of your sleep

81
00:04:48,366 --> 00:04:49,913
when you do get it

82
00:04:49,937 --> 00:04:53,749
that restores and enhances your memory and learning ability

83
00:04:53,773 --> 00:04:54,923
each and every day?

84
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:58,806
And by placing electrodes all over the head,

85
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,877
what we've discovered is that there are big, powerful brainwaves

86
00:05:02,901 --> 00:05:06,520
that happen during the very deepest stages of sleep

87
00:05:06,544 --> 00:05:08,829
that have riding on top of them

88
00:05:08,853 --> 00:05:12,127
these spectacular bursts of electrical activity

89
00:05:12,151 --> 00:05:13,885
that we call sleep spindles.

90
00:05:14,886 --> 00:05:19,308
And it's the combined quality of these deep-sleep brainwaves

91
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:23,793
that acts like a file-transfer mechanism at night,

92
00:05:23,817 --> 00:05:27,888
shifting memories from a short-term vulnerable reservoir

93
00:05:27,912 --> 00:05:32,254
to a more permanent long-term storage site within the brain,

94
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:35,668
and therefore protecting them, making them safe.

95
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:39,326
And it is important that we understand

96
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:44,409
what during sleep actually transacts these memory benefits,

97
00:05:44,433 --> 00:05:48,567
because there are real medical and societal implications.

98
00:05:48,591 --> 00:05:50,608
And let me just tell you about one area

99
00:05:50,632 --> 00:05:54,068
that we've moved this work out into, clinically,

100
00:05:54,092 --> 00:05:57,305
which is the context of aging and dementia.

101
00:05:58,690 --> 00:06:02,115
Because it's of course no secret that, as we get older,

102
00:06:02,139 --> 00:06:05,424
our learning and memory abilities begin to fade and decline.

103
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:08,489
But what we've also discovered

104
00:06:08,513 --> 00:06:15,298
is that a physiological signature of aging is that your sleep gets worse,

105
00:06:15,322 --> 00:06:19,126
especially that deep quality of sleep that I was just discussing.

106
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,554
And only last year, we finally published evidence

107
00:06:23,578 --> 00:06:26,537
that these two things, they're not simply co-occurring,

108
00:06:26,561 --> 00:06:29,379
they are significantly interrelated.

109
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:33,944
And it suggests that the disruption of deep sleep

110
00:06:33,968 --> 00:06:36,262
is an underappreciated factor

111
00:06:36,286 --> 00:06:40,199
that is contributing to cognitive decline or memory decline

112
00:06:40,223 --> 00:06:43,801
in aging, and most recently we've discovered,

113
00:06:43,825 --> 00:06:46,047
in Alzheimer's disease as well.

114
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:51,888
Now, I know this is remarkably depressing news.

115
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,215
It's in the mail. It's coming at you.

116
00:06:54,239 --> 00:06:56,524
But there's a potential silver lining here.

117
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:02,438
Unlike many of the other factors that we know are associated with aging,

118
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:06,121
for example changes in the physical structure of the brain,

119
00:07:06,145 --> 00:07:09,207
that's fiendishly difficult to treat.

120
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:13,787
But that sleep is a missing piece in the explanatory puzzle

121
00:07:13,811 --> 00:07:16,406
of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting

122
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:19,168
because we may be able to do something about it.

123
00:07:20,350 --> 00:07:24,281
And one way that we are approaching this at my sleep center

124
00:07:24,305 --> 00:07:27,313
is not by using sleeping pills, by the way.

125
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:32,266
Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments that do not produce naturalistic sleep.

126
00:07:33,352 --> 00:07:36,599
Instead, we're actually developing a method based on this.

127
00:07:36,623 --> 00:07:39,838
It's called direct current brain stimulation.

128
00:07:39,862 --> 00:07:43,143
You insert a small amount of voltage into the brain,

129
00:07:43,167 --> 00:07:45,405
so small you typically don't feel it,

130
00:07:45,429 --> 00:07:47,321
but it has a measurable impact.

131
00:07:48,646 --> 00:07:54,987
Now if you apply this stimulation during sleep in young, healthy adults,

132
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:59,726
as if you're sort of singing in time with those deep-sleep brainwaves,

133
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:04,292
not only can you amplify the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves,

134
00:08:04,316 --> 00:08:08,860
but in doing so, we can almost double the amount of memory benefit

135
00:08:08,884 --> 00:08:10,918
that you get from sleep.

136
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:13,757
The question now is whether we can translate

137
00:08:13,781 --> 00:08:18,082
this same affordable, potentially portable piece of technology

138
00:08:18,106 --> 00:08:20,987
into older adults and those with dementia.

139
00:08:22,546 --> 00:08:27,132
Can we restore back some healthy quality of deep sleep,

140
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:31,775
and in doing so, can we salvage aspects of their learning

141
00:08:31,799 --> 00:08:33,283
and memory function?

142
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:35,473
That is my real hope now.

143
00:08:36,198 --> 00:08:39,203
That's one of our moon-shot goals, as it were.

144
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:44,513
So that's an example of sleep for your brain,

145
00:08:44,537 --> 00:08:47,750
but sleep is just as essential for your body.

146
00:08:49,096 --> 00:08:52,771
We've already spoken about sleep loss and your reproductive system.

147
00:08:53,683 --> 00:08:58,545
Or I could tell you about sleep loss and your cardiovascular system,

148
00:08:58,569 --> 00:09:01,743
and that all it takes is one hour.

149
00:09:01,767 --> 00:09:07,275
Because there is a global experiment performed on 1.6 billion people

150
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:11,576
across 70 countries twice a year,

151
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,489
and it's called daylight saving time.

152
00:09:14,727 --> 00:09:18,185
Now, in the spring, when we lose one hour of sleep,

153
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:23,828
we see a subsequent 24-percent increase in heart attacks that following day.

154
00:09:26,772 --> 00:09:29,947
In the autumn, when we gain an hour of sleep,

155
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:33,839
we see a 21-percent reduction in heart attacks.

156
00:09:35,572 --> 00:09:37,252
Isn't that incredible?

157
00:09:38,749 --> 00:09:44,425
And you see exactly the same profile for car crashes, road traffic accidents,

158
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:46,351
even suicide rates.

159
00:09:48,748 --> 00:09:51,653
But as a deeper dive, I want to focus on this:

160
00:09:51,677 --> 00:09:54,168
sleep loss and your immune system.

161
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:59,811
And here, I'll introduce these delightful blue elements in the image.

162
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:03,013
They are called natural killer cells,

163
00:10:03,037 --> 00:10:07,887
and you can think of natural killer cells almost like the secret service agents

164
00:10:07,911 --> 00:10:09,522
of your immune system.

165
00:10:09,546 --> 00:10:14,529
They are very good at identifying dangerous, unwanted elements

166
00:10:14,553 --> 00:10:15,950
and eliminating them.

167
00:10:17,073 --> 00:10:21,017
In fact, what they're doing here is destroying a cancerous tumor mass.

168
00:10:22,406 --> 00:10:28,342
So what you wish for is a virile set of these immune assassins

169
00:10:28,366 --> 00:10:30,422
at all times,

170
00:10:30,446 --> 00:10:34,256
and tragically, that's what you don't have if you're not sleeping enough.

171
00:10:35,645 --> 00:10:37,289
So here in this experiment,

172
00:10:37,313 --> 00:10:41,142
you're not going to have your sleep deprived for an entire night,

173
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:44,677
you're simply going to have your sleep restricted to four hours

174
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:46,479
for one single night,

175
00:10:46,503 --> 00:10:49,504
and then we're going to look to see what's the percent reduction

176
00:10:49,528 --> 00:10:51,518
in immune cell activity that you suffer.

177
00:10:52,594 --> 00:10:55,423
And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent,

178
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:57,450
it's not 20 percent.

179
00:10:57,474 --> 00:11:02,046
There was a 70-percent drop in natural killer cell activity.

180
00:11:03,606 --> 00:11:07,661
That's a concerning state of immune deficiency,

181
00:11:09,178 --> 00:11:11,995
and you can perhaps understand why we're now finding

182
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:15,875
significant links between short sleep duration

183
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,812
and your risk for the development of numerous forms of cancer.

184
00:11:21,712 --> 00:11:24,495
Currently, that list includes cancer of the bowel,

185
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:27,781
cancer of the prostate and cancer of the breast.

186
00:11:29,673 --> 00:11:35,029
In fact, the link between a lack of sleep and cancer is now so strong

187
00:11:35,053 --> 00:11:37,435
that the World Health Organization

188
00:11:37,459 --> 00:11:41,649
has classified any form of nighttime shift work

189
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:44,855
as a probable carcinogen,

190
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,546
because of a disruption of your sleep-wake rhythms.

191
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:52,380
So you may have heard of that old maxim

192
00:11:52,404 --> 00:11:54,516
that you can sleep when you're dead.

193
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,610
Well, I'm being quite serious now --

194
00:11:56,634 --> 00:11:59,245
it is mortally unwise advice.

195
00:12:00,195 --> 00:12:05,232
We know this from epidemiological studies across millions of individuals.

196
00:12:05,256 --> 00:12:07,237
There's a simple truth:

197
00:12:07,261 --> 00:12:10,665
the shorter your sleep, the shorter your life.

198
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:14,244
Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality.

199
00:12:16,760 --> 00:12:20,929
And if increasing your risk for the development of cancer

200
00:12:20,953 --> 00:12:23,197
or even Alzheimer's disease

201
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:27,397
were not sufficiently disquieting,

202
00:12:27,421 --> 00:12:31,119
we have since discovered that a lack of sleep will even erode

203
00:12:31,143 --> 00:12:35,216
the very fabric of biological life itself,

204
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:38,493
your DNA genetic code.

205
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:43,794
So here in this study, they took a group of healthy adults

206
00:12:43,818 --> 00:12:47,557
and they limited them to six hours of sleep a night

207
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:49,232
for one week,

208
00:12:49,256 --> 00:12:53,053
and then they measured the change in their gene activity profile

209
00:12:53,077 --> 00:12:55,521
relative to when those same individuals

210
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:58,092
were getting a full eight hours of sleep a night.

211
00:12:59,271 --> 00:13:01,087
And there were two critical findings.

212
00:13:02,024 --> 00:13:07,095
First, a sizable and significant 711 genes

213
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:09,447
were distorted in their activity,

214
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:10,914
caused by a lack of sleep.

215
00:13:11,743 --> 00:13:14,870
The second result was that about half of those genes

216
00:13:14,894 --> 00:13:17,337
were actually increased in their activity.

217
00:13:17,662 --> 00:13:19,591
The other half were decreased.

218
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:23,549
Now those genes that were switched off by a lack of sleep

219
00:13:23,573 --> 00:13:27,062
were genes associated with your immune system,

220
00:13:27,086 --> 00:13:29,926
so once again, you can see that immune deficiency.

221
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:34,241
In contrast, those genes that were actually upregulated

222
00:13:34,265 --> 00:13:36,637
or increased by way of a lack of sleep,

223
00:13:36,661 --> 00:13:40,559
were genes associated with the promotion of tumors,

224
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:45,734
genes associated with long-term chronic inflammation within the body,

225
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,560
and genes associated with stress,

226
00:13:48,584 --> 00:13:51,613
and, as a consequence, cardiovascular disease.

227
00:13:52,991 --> 00:13:56,651
There is simply no aspect of your wellness

228
00:13:56,675 --> 00:13:59,942
that can retreat at the sign of sleep deprivation

229
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:01,780
and get away unscathed.

230
00:14:02,732 --> 00:14:05,740
It's rather like a broken water pipe in your home.

231
00:14:05,764 --> 00:14:09,407
Sleep loss will leak down into every nook and cranny

232
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,817
of your physiology,

233
00:14:11,841 --> 00:14:15,746
even tampering with the very DNA nucleic alphabet

234
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,610
that spells out your daily health narrative.

235
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:24,369
And at this point, you may be thinking,

236
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:26,925
"Oh my goodness, how do I start to get better sleep?

237
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,194
What are you tips for good sleep?"

238
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,378
Well, beyond avoiding the damaging and harmful impact

239
00:14:34,402 --> 00:14:37,321
of alcohol and caffeine on sleep,

240
00:14:37,345 --> 00:14:39,782
and if you're struggling with sleep at night,

241
00:14:39,806 --> 00:14:41,987
avoiding naps during the day,

242
00:14:42,011 --> 00:14:44,154
I have two pieces of advice for you.

243
00:14:44,924 --> 00:14:47,738
The first is regularity.

244
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:51,163
Go to bed at the same time, wake up at the same time,

245
00:14:51,187 --> 00:14:54,248
no matter whether it's the weekday or the weekend.

246
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:57,017
Regularity is king,

247
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,002
and it will anchor your sleep

248
00:14:59,026 --> 00:15:02,338
and improve the quantity and the quality of that sleep.

249
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:06,874
The second is keep it cool.

250
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,335
Your body needs to drop its core temperature

251
00:15:10,359 --> 00:15:14,572
by about two to three degrees Fahrenheit to initiate sleep

252
00:15:14,596 --> 00:15:16,676
and then to stay asleep,

253
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:19,192
and it's the reason you will always find it easier

254
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:21,597
to fall asleep in a room that's too cold

255
00:15:21,621 --> 00:15:22,865
than too hot.

256
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,349
So aim for a bedroom temperature of around 65 degrees,

257
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:29,327
or about 18 degrees Celsius.

258
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:32,118
That's going to be optimal for the sleep of most people.

259
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:37,763
And then finally, in taking a step back, then,

260
00:15:37,787 --> 00:15:40,980
what is the mission-critical statement here?

261
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,807
Well, I think it may be this:

262
00:15:44,831 --> 00:15:50,103
sleep, unfortunately, is not an optional lifestyle luxury.

263
00:15:50,925 --> 00:15:55,472
Sleep is a nonnegotiable biological necessity.

264
00:15:56,712 --> 00:16:00,303
It is your life-support system,

265
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:04,961
and it is Mother Nature's best effort yet at immortality.

266
00:16:06,529 --> 00:16:11,045
And the decimation of sleep throughout industrialized nations

267
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:16,286
is having a catastrophic impact on our health, our wellness,

268
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,976
even the safety and the education of our children.

269
00:16:20,143 --> 00:16:23,159
It's a silent sleep loss epidemic,

270
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:26,548
and it's fast becoming one of the greatest public health challenges

271
00:16:26,572 --> 00:16:29,294
that we face in the 21st century.

272
00:16:32,114 --> 00:16:37,197
I believe it is now time for us to reclaim our right

273
00:16:37,221 --> 00:16:38,692
to a full night of sleep,

274
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:41,989
and without embarrassment

275
00:16:42,013 --> 00:16:45,412
or that unfortunate stigma of laziness.

276
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:52,442
And in doing so, we can be reunited with the most powerful elixir of life,

277
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:56,561
the Swiss Army knife of health, as it were.

278
00:16:58,487 --> 00:17:01,131
And with that soapbox rant over,

279
00:17:01,155 --> 00:17:03,250
I will simply say, good night, good luck,

280
00:17:03,274 --> 00:17:04,424
and above all ...

281
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:08,471
I do hope you sleep well.

282
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:09,853
Thank you very much indeed.

283
00:17:09,877 --> 00:17:14,408
(Applause)

284
00:17:14,432 --> 00:17:15,590
Thank you.

285
00:17:15,614 --> 00:17:18,456
(Applause)

286
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,023
Thank you so much.

287
00:17:20,047 --> 00:17:22,790
David Biello: No, no, no. Stay there for a second.

288
00:17:22,814 --> 00:17:25,366
Good job not running away, though. I appreciate that.

289
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,634
So that was terrifying.

290
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:29,754
Matt Walker: You're welcome. DB: Yes, thank you, thank you.

291
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:35,310
Since we can't catch up on sleep, what are we supposed to do?

292
00:17:35,334 --> 00:17:38,866
What do we do when we're, like, tossing and turning in bed late at night

293
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:41,952
or doing shift work or whatever else?

294
00:17:41,976 --> 00:17:44,317
MW: So you're right, we can't catch up on sleep.

295
00:17:44,341 --> 00:17:45,666
Sleep is not like the bank.

296
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:47,730
You can't accumulate a debt

297
00:17:47,754 --> 00:17:50,446
and then hope to pay it off at a later point in time.

298
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:53,614
I should also note the reason that it's so catastrophic

299
00:17:53,638 --> 00:17:56,692
and that our health deteriorates so quickly,

300
00:17:56,716 --> 00:17:59,453
first, it's because human beings are the only species

301
00:17:59,477 --> 00:18:01,955
that deliberately deprive themselves of sleep

302
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:04,368
for no apparent reason.

303
00:18:04,392 --> 00:18:05,544
DB: Because we're smart.

304
00:18:05,568 --> 00:18:10,393
MW: And I make that point because it means that Mother Nature,

305
00:18:10,417 --> 00:18:12,107
throughout the course of evolution,

306
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:16,434
has never had to face the challenge of this thing called sleep deprivation.

307
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:20,527
So she's never developed a safety net,

308
00:18:20,551 --> 00:18:22,679
and that's why when you undersleep,

309
00:18:22,703 --> 00:18:27,037
things just sort of implode so quickly, both within the brain and the body.

310
00:18:27,061 --> 00:18:29,834
So you just have to prioritize.

311
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:33,160
DB: OK, but tossing and turning in bed,

312
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:34,595
what do I do?

313
00:18:34,619 --> 00:18:39,238
MW: So if you are staying in bed awake for too long,

314
00:18:39,262 --> 00:18:42,515
you should get out of bed and go to a different room

315
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:43,852
and do something different.

316
00:18:43,876 --> 00:18:48,197
The reason is because your brain will very quickly associate your bedroom

317
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:50,540
with the place of wakefulness,

318
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,253
and you need to break that association.

319
00:18:53,277 --> 00:18:56,174
So only return to bed when you are sleepy,

320
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:59,737
and that way you will relearn the association that you once had,

321
00:18:59,761 --> 00:19:02,269
which is your bed is the place of sleep.

322
00:19:02,293 --> 00:19:03,952
So the analogy would be,

323
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,552
you'd never sit at the dinner table, waiting to get hungry,

324
00:19:07,576 --> 00:19:10,539
so why would you lie in bed, waiting to get sleepy?

325
00:19:11,368 --> 00:19:13,368
DB: Well, thank you for that wake-up call.

326
00:19:13,392 --> 00:19:14,561
Great job, Matt.

327
00:19:14,585 --> 00:19:16,781
MW: You're very welcome. Thank you very much.
