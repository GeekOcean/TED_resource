1
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,288
So, I'm an artist.

2
00:00:14,288 --> 00:00:16,742
I live in New York, and I've been working in advertising

3
00:00:16,742 --> 00:00:19,387
for -- ever since I left school,

4
00:00:19,387 --> 00:00:21,008
so about seven, eight years now,

5
00:00:21,008 --> 00:00:22,564
and it was draining.

6
00:00:22,564 --> 00:00:25,277
I worked a lot of late nights. I worked a lot of weekends,

7
00:00:25,277 --> 00:00:28,447
and I found myself never having time for all the projects

8
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:30,749
that I wanted to work on on my own.

9
00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:32,711
And one day I was at work and I saw a talk

10
00:00:32,711 --> 00:00:34,942
by Stefan Sagmeister on TED,

11
00:00:34,942 --> 00:00:36,597
and it was called "The power of time off,"

12
00:00:36,597 --> 00:00:39,233
and he spoke about how every seven years,

13
00:00:39,233 --> 00:00:41,340
he takes a year off from work so he could

14
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,005
do his own creative projects, and I was instantly inspired,

15
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:48,394
and I just said, "I have to do that. I have to take a year off.

16
00:00:48,394 --> 00:00:52,873
I need to take time to travel and spend time with my family

17
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:55,159
and start my own creative ideas."

18
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:58,798
So the first of those projects ended up being

19
00:00:58,798 --> 00:01:02,364
something I called "One Second Every Day."

20
00:01:02,364 --> 00:01:04,698
Basically I'm recording one second of every day of my life

21
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:07,433
for the rest of my life,

22
00:01:07,433 --> 00:01:10,370
chronologically compiling these one-second

23
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:14,672
tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video

24
00:01:14,672 --> 00:01:20,349
until, you know, I can't record them anymore.

25
00:01:20,349 --> 00:01:22,706
The purpose of this project is, one:

26
00:01:22,706 --> 00:01:27,430
I hate not remembering things that I've done in the past.

27
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,140
There's all these things that I've done with my life

28
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,054
that I have no recollection of

29
00:01:32,054 --> 00:01:33,770
unless someone brings it up, and sometimes I think,

30
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:37,341
"Oh yeah, that's something that I did."

31
00:01:37,341 --> 00:01:38,982
And something that I realized early on in the project

32
00:01:38,982 --> 00:01:41,706
was that if I wasn't doing anything interesting,

33
00:01:41,706 --> 00:01:44,185
I would probably forget to record the video.

34
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:47,658
So the day -- the first time that I forgot, it really hurt me,

35
00:01:47,658 --> 00:01:50,133
because it's something that I really wanted to --

36
00:01:50,133 --> 00:01:52,329
from the moment that I turned 30, I wanted

37
00:01:52,329 --> 00:01:55,679
to keep this project going until forever,

38
00:01:55,679 --> 00:01:58,125
and having missed that one second, I realized,

39
00:01:58,125 --> 00:02:01,878
it just kind of created this thing in my head

40
00:02:01,878 --> 00:02:04,141
where I never forgot ever again.

41
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:10,417
So if I live to see 80 years of age,

42
00:02:10,417 --> 00:02:13,050
I'm going to have a five-hour video

43
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:15,799
that encapsulates 50 years of my life.

44
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:18,191
When I turn 40, I'll have a one-hour video

45
00:02:18,191 --> 00:02:23,428
that includes just my 30s.

46
00:02:23,428 --> 00:02:24,956
This has really

47
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:28,231
invigorated me day-to-day, when I wake up,

48
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,118
to try and do something interesting with my day.

49
00:02:38,577 --> 00:02:42,085
Now, one of the things that I have issues with is that,

50
00:02:42,085 --> 00:02:46,283
as the days and weeks and months go by,

51
00:02:46,283 --> 00:02:48,100
time just seems to start blurring

52
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,022
and blending into each other

53
00:02:50,022 --> 00:02:53,753
and, you know, I hated that,

54
00:02:53,753 --> 00:02:58,782
and visualization is the way to trigger memory.

55
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:09,701
You know, this project for me is a way for me

56
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:12,995
to bridge that gap and remember everything that I've done.

57
00:03:12,995 --> 00:03:15,562
Even just this one second allows me to remember

58
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,839
everything else I did that one day.

59
00:03:17,839 --> 00:03:20,501
It's difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second.

60
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:23,685
On a good day, I'll have maybe three or four seconds

61
00:03:23,685 --> 00:03:25,398
that I really want to choose,

62
00:03:25,398 --> 00:03:27,547
but I'll just have to narrow it down to one,

63
00:03:27,547 --> 00:03:29,511
but even narrowing it down to that one allows me

64
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:31,991
to remember the other three anyway.

65
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:35,532
It's also kind of a protest, a personal protest,

66
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:37,927
against the culture we have now where people

67
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:40,369
just are at concerts with their cell phones out

68
00:03:40,369 --> 00:03:42,518
recording the whole concert, and they're disturbing you.

69
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:43,753
They're not even enjoying the show.

70
00:03:43,753 --> 00:03:46,858
They're watching the concert through their cell phone.

71
00:03:46,858 --> 00:03:50,826
I hate that. I admittedly used to be that guy a little bit,

72
00:03:50,826 --> 00:03:53,644
back in the day, and I've decided that the best way

73
00:03:53,644 --> 00:03:59,225
for me to still capture and keep a visual memory of my life

74
00:03:59,225 --> 00:04:02,311
and not be that person, is to just record that one second

75
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:04,580
that will allow me to trigger that memory of,

76
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,955
"Yeah, that concert was amazing. I really loved that concert."

77
00:04:07,955 --> 00:04:13,373
And it just takes a quick, quick second.

78
00:04:13,373 --> 00:04:16,252
I was on a three-month road trip this summer.

79
00:04:16,252 --> 00:04:19,106
It was something that I've been dreaming about doing my whole life,

80
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:21,599
just driving around the U.S. and Canada

81
00:04:21,599 --> 00:04:24,838
and just figuring out where to go the next day,

82
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:27,443
and it was kind of outstanding.

83
00:04:27,443 --> 00:04:31,155
I actually ran out, I spent too much money on my road trip

84
00:04:31,155 --> 00:04:34,145
for the savings that I had to take my year off,

85
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:37,039
so I had to, I went to Seattle and I spent some time

86
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:40,589
with friends working on a really neat project.

87
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:51,691
One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family,

88
00:04:51,691 --> 00:04:55,101
and this really tragic thing happened where

89
00:04:55,101 --> 00:04:56,706
my sister-in-law,

90
00:04:56,706 --> 00:05:00,142
her intestine suddenly strangled one day,

91
00:05:00,142 --> 00:05:02,920
and we took her to the emergency room,

92
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:06,212
and she was, she was in really bad shape.

93
00:05:06,212 --> 00:05:08,287
We almost lost her a couple of times,

94
00:05:08,287 --> 00:05:11,699
and I was there with my brother every day.

95
00:05:15,728 --> 00:05:18,504
It helped me realize something else during this project,

96
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:25,019
is that recording that one second on a really bad day

97
00:05:25,019 --> 00:05:26,252
is extremely difficult.

98
00:05:26,252 --> 00:05:31,449
It's not -- we tend to take our cameras out when we're doing awesome things.

99
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:33,873
Or we're, "Oh, yeah, this party, let me take a picture."

100
00:05:33,873 --> 00:05:36,875
But we rarely do that when we're having a bad day,

101
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,756
and something horrible is happening.

102
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:42,176
And I found that it's actually been very, very important

103
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:45,720
to record even just that one second of a really bad moment.

104
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:49,421
It really helps you appreciate the good times.

105
00:05:49,421 --> 00:05:53,708
It's not always a good day, so when you have a bad one,

106
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,606
I think it's important to remember it,

107
00:05:55,606 --> 00:06:01,230
just as much as it is important to remember the [good] days.

108
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,166
Now one of the things that I do is I don't use any filters,

109
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:15,945
I don't use anything to -- I try to capture the moment

110
00:06:15,945 --> 00:06:21,572
as much as possible as the way that I saw it with my own eyes.

111
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:24,307
I started a rule of first person perspective.

112
00:06:24,307 --> 00:06:26,380
Early on, I think I had a couple of videos where

113
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:30,593
you would see me in it, but I realized that wasn't the way to go.

114
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:32,440
The way to really remember what I saw

115
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:37,306
was to record it as I actually saw it.

116
00:06:44,357 --> 00:06:48,619
Now a couple of things that I have in my head about this project are,

117
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:54,594
wouldn't it be interesting if thousands of people were doing this?

118
00:06:54,594 --> 00:07:00,849
I turned 31 last week, which is there.

119
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:02,577
I think it would be interesting to see

120
00:07:02,577 --> 00:07:04,425
what everyone did with a project like this.

121
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:06,417
I think everyone would have a different interpretation of it.

122
00:07:06,417 --> 00:07:11,155
I think everyone would benefit from just having that one second to remember every day.

123
00:07:11,155 --> 00:07:14,006
Personally, I'm tired of forgetting,

124
00:07:14,006 --> 00:07:16,577
and this is a really easy thing to do.

125
00:07:16,577 --> 00:07:19,446
I mean, we all have HD-capable cameras in our pockets right now --

126
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:21,276
most people in this room, I bet --

127
00:07:21,276 --> 00:07:22,866
and it's something that's --

128
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:25,124
I never want to forget another day that I've ever lived,

129
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:27,405
and this is my way of doing that,

130
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,190
and it'd be really interesting also to see,

131
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,160
if you could just type in on a website,

132
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,366
"June 18, 2018,"

133
00:07:35,366 --> 00:07:37,717
and you would just see a stream of people's lives

134
00:07:37,717 --> 00:07:39,411
on that particular day from all over the world.

135
00:07:39,411 --> 00:07:42,633
And I don't know, I think this project has a lot of possibilities,

136
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:46,280
and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day,

137
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,127
so you can never forget that that day, you lived.

138
00:07:48,127 --> 00:07:49,831
Thank you.

139
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:54,268
(Applause)
