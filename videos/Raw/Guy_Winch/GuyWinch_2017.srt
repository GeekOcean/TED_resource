1
00:00:12,732 --> 00:00:14,678
At some point in our lives,

2
00:00:14,702 --> 00:00:17,667
almost every one of us will have our heart broken.

3
00:00:18,651 --> 00:00:23,023
My patient Kathy planned her wedding when she was in middle school.

4
00:00:23,047 --> 00:00:24,884
She would meet her future husband

5
00:00:24,908 --> 00:00:26,541
by age 27,

6
00:00:26,565 --> 00:00:28,352
get engaged a year later

7
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,619
and get married a year after that.

8
00:00:31,396 --> 00:00:35,336
But when Kathy turned 27, she didn't find a husband.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,600
She found a lump in her breast.

10
00:00:38,115 --> 00:00:41,223
She went through many months of harsh chemotherapy

11
00:00:41,247 --> 00:00:43,021
and painful surgeries,

12
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:47,549
and then just as she was ready to jump back into the dating world,

13
00:00:47,573 --> 00:00:49,943
she found a lump in her other breast

14
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,709
and had to do it all over again.

15
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:54,254
Kathy recovered, though,

16
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:57,213
and she was eager to resume her search for a husband

17
00:00:57,237 --> 00:00:59,652
as soon as her eyebrows grew back in.

18
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,745
When you're going on first dates in New York City,

19
00:01:02,769 --> 00:01:05,756
you need to be able to express a wide range of emotions.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:07,163
(Laughter)

21
00:01:07,187 --> 00:01:10,379
Soon afterwards, she met Rich and fell in love.

22
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,569
The relationship was everything she hoped it would be.

23
00:01:14,434 --> 00:01:15,698
Six months later,

24
00:01:15,722 --> 00:01:18,197
after a lovely weekend in New England,

25
00:01:18,221 --> 00:01:21,763
Rich made reservations at their favorite romantic restaurant.

26
00:01:22,697 --> 00:01:24,623
Kathy knew he was going to propose,

27
00:01:24,647 --> 00:01:27,670
and she could barely contain her excitement.

28
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:31,131
But Rich did not propose to Kathy that night.

29
00:01:31,586 --> 00:01:32,788
He broke up with her.

30
00:01:33,459 --> 00:01:36,100
As deeply as he cared for Kathy -- and he did --

31
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,151
he simply wasn't in love.

32
00:01:39,285 --> 00:01:41,229
Kathy was shattered.

33
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:46,096
Her heart was truly broken, and she now faced yet another recovery.

34
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:49,335
But five months after the breakup,

35
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:52,554
Kathy still couldn't stop thinking about Rich.

36
00:01:52,578 --> 00:01:55,192
Her heart was still very much broken.

37
00:01:55,946 --> 00:01:57,123
The question is:

38
00:01:57,606 --> 00:01:59,040
Why?

39
00:01:59,064 --> 00:02:03,160
Why was this incredibly strong and determined woman

40
00:02:03,184 --> 00:02:06,092
unable to marshal the same emotional resources

41
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:09,535
that got her through four years of cancer treatments?

42
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:12,718
Why do so many of us flounder

43
00:02:12,742 --> 00:02:15,221
when we're trying to recover from heartbreak?

44
00:02:15,895 --> 00:02:17,900
Why do the same coping mechanisms

45
00:02:17,924 --> 00:02:21,048
that get us through all kinds of life challenges

46
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:24,260
fail us so miserably when our heart gets broken?

47
00:02:25,706 --> 00:02:28,142
In over 20 years of private practice,

48
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,146
I have seen people of every age and background

49
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,795
face every manner of heartbreak,

50
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,891
and what I've learned is this:

51
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:39,200
when your heart is broken,

52
00:02:39,224 --> 00:02:42,114
the same instincts you ordinarily rely on

53
00:02:42,138 --> 00:02:46,604
will time and again lead you down the wrong path.

54
00:02:46,628 --> 00:02:50,243
You simply cannot trust what your mind is telling you.

55
00:02:51,265 --> 00:02:54,145
For example, we know from studies of heartbroken people

56
00:02:54,169 --> 00:02:57,595
that having a clear understanding of why the relationship ended

57
00:02:57,619 --> 00:03:00,429
is really important for our ability to move on.

58
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:02,827
Yet time and again,

59
00:03:02,851 --> 00:03:06,208
when we are offered a simple and honest explanation

60
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:08,544
like the one Rich offered Kathy,

61
00:03:08,568 --> 00:03:09,726
we reject it.

62
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,518
Heartbreak creates such dramatic emotional pain,

63
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:18,110
our mind tells us the cause must be equally dramatic.

64
00:03:18,685 --> 00:03:21,141
And that gut instinct is so powerful,

65
00:03:21,165 --> 00:03:24,401
it can make even the most reasonable and measured of us

66
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:27,824
come up with mysteries and conspiracy theories

67
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:29,035
where none exist.

68
00:03:29,837 --> 00:03:32,611
Kathy became convinced something must have happened

69
00:03:32,635 --> 00:03:34,742
during her romantic getaway with Rich

70
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:36,688
that soured him on the relationship,

71
00:03:36,712 --> 00:03:39,690
and she became obsessed with figuring out what that was.

72
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:42,154
And so she spent countless hours

73
00:03:42,178 --> 00:03:45,705
going through every minute of that weekend in her mind,

74
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,877
searching her memory for clues that were not there.

75
00:03:50,153 --> 00:03:54,055
Kathy's mind tricked her into initiating this wild goose chase.

76
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,431
But what compelled her to commit to it for so many months?

77
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:03,373
Heartbreak is far more insidious than we realize.

78
00:04:03,397 --> 00:04:07,846
There is a reason we keep going down one rabbit hole after another,

79
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:10,651
even when we know it's going to make us feel worse.

80
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:13,262
Brain studies have shown

81
00:04:13,286 --> 00:04:15,779
that the withdrawal of romantic love

82
00:04:15,803 --> 00:04:19,289
activates the same mechanisms in our brain that get activated

83
00:04:19,313 --> 00:04:24,350
when addicts are withdrawing from substances like cocaine or opioids.

84
00:04:25,184 --> 00:04:27,155
Kathy was going through withdrawal.

85
00:04:27,758 --> 00:04:31,548
And since she could not have the heroin of actually being with Rich,

86
00:04:31,572 --> 00:04:36,047
her unconscious mind chose the methadone of her memories with him.

87
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:39,808
Her instincts told her she was trying to solve a mystery,

88
00:04:39,832 --> 00:04:41,762
but what she was actually doing

89
00:04:41,786 --> 00:04:43,358
was getting her fix.

90
00:04:44,881 --> 00:04:48,354
This is what makes heartbreak so difficult to heal.

91
00:04:49,237 --> 00:04:51,245
Addicts know they're addicted.

92
00:04:51,269 --> 00:04:53,379
They know when they're shooting up.

93
00:04:53,403 --> 00:04:55,300
But heartbroken people do not.

94
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:57,643
But you do now.

95
00:04:58,407 --> 00:05:01,966
And if your heart is broken, you cannot ignore that.

96
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:06,286
You have to recognize that, as compelling as the urge is,

97
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:09,721
with every trip down memory lane, every text you send,

98
00:05:09,745 --> 00:05:13,228
every second you spend stalking your ex on social media,

99
00:05:13,252 --> 00:05:15,392
you are just feeding your addiction,

100
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,206
deepening your emotional pain

101
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,989
and complicating your recovery.

102
00:05:20,727 --> 00:05:23,514
Getting over heartbreak is not a journey.

103
00:05:23,538 --> 00:05:27,706
It's a fight, and your reason is your strongest weapon.

104
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:31,524
There is no breakup explanation that's going to feel satisfying.

105
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:34,387
No rationale can take away the pain you feel.

106
00:05:34,411 --> 00:05:37,071
So don't search for one, don't wait for one,

107
00:05:37,095 --> 00:05:40,144
just accept the one you were offered or make up one yourself

108
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:42,088
and then put the question to rest,

109
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:45,232
because you need that closure to resist the addiction.

110
00:05:46,677 --> 00:05:49,222
And you need something else as well:

111
00:05:50,257 --> 00:05:52,653
you have to be willing to let go,

112
00:05:53,449 --> 00:05:55,365
to accept that it's over.

113
00:05:56,101 --> 00:05:58,665
Otherwise, your mind will feed on your hope

114
00:05:58,689 --> 00:05:59,977
and set you back.

115
00:06:01,363 --> 00:06:05,323
Hope can be incredibly destructive when your heart is broken.

116
00:06:07,098 --> 00:06:10,101
Heartbreak is a master manipulator.

117
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:13,778
The ease with which it gets our mind to do the absolute opposite

118
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:15,828
of what we need in order to recover

119
00:06:15,852 --> 00:06:17,073
is remarkable.

120
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:21,618
One of the most common tendencies we have when our heart is broken

121
00:06:21,642 --> 00:06:23,839
is to idealize the person who broke it.

122
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:27,492
We spend hours remembering their smile,

123
00:06:27,516 --> 00:06:29,658
how great they made us feel,

124
00:06:29,682 --> 00:06:33,977
that time we hiked up the mountain and made love under the stars.

125
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:38,353
All that does is make our loss feel more painful.

126
00:06:38,757 --> 00:06:40,013
We know that.

127
00:06:40,037 --> 00:06:44,935
Yet we still allow our mind to cycle through one greatest hit after another,

128
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:49,557
like we were being held hostage by our own passive-aggressive Spotify playlist.

129
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:51,937
(Laughter)

130
00:06:53,842 --> 00:06:56,892
Heartbreak will make those thoughts pop into your mind.

131
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,722
And so to avoid idealizing, you have to balance them out

132
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:03,859
by remembering their frown, not just their smile,

133
00:07:04,246 --> 00:07:06,363
how bad they made you feel,

134
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:10,049
the fact that after the lovemaking, you got lost coming down the mountain,

135
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:12,792
argued like crazy and didn't speak for two days.

136
00:07:14,237 --> 00:07:18,468
What I tell my patients is to compile an exhaustive list

137
00:07:18,492 --> 00:07:20,889
of all the ways the person was wrong for you,

138
00:07:20,913 --> 00:07:23,401
all the bad qualities, all the pet peeves,

139
00:07:23,425 --> 00:07:25,793
and then keep it on your phone.

140
00:07:25,817 --> 00:07:26,860
(Laughter)

141
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:28,971
And once you have your list,

142
00:07:28,995 --> 00:07:30,240
you have to use it.

143
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,409
When I hear even a hint of idealizing

144
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,526
or the faintest whiff of nostalgia in a session,

145
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,534
I go, "Phone, please."

146
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,379
(Laughter)

147
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:43,436
Your mind will try to tell you they were perfect.

148
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:46,175
But they were not, and neither was the relationship.

149
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:50,036
And if you want to get over them, you have to remind yourself of that,

150
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:51,242
frequently.

151
00:07:52,181 --> 00:07:54,771
None of us is immune to heartbreak.

152
00:07:55,509 --> 00:08:00,562
My patient Miguel was a 56-year-old senior executive in a software company.

153
00:08:01,028 --> 00:08:03,325
Five years after his wife died,

154
00:08:03,349 --> 00:08:05,978
he finally felt ready to start dating again.

155
00:08:06,474 --> 00:08:07,712
He soon met Sharon,

156
00:08:07,736 --> 00:08:10,265
and a whirlwind romance ensued.

157
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:13,699
They introduced each other to their adult children after one month,

158
00:08:13,723 --> 00:08:16,228
and they moved in together after two.

159
00:08:16,685 --> 00:08:19,376
When middle-aged people date, they don't mess around.

160
00:08:20,225 --> 00:08:23,498
It's like "Love, Actually" meets "The Fast and the Furious."

161
00:08:23,522 --> 00:08:25,084
(Laughter)

162
00:08:26,315 --> 00:08:28,883
Miguel was happier than he had been in years.

163
00:08:29,359 --> 00:08:32,113
But the night before their first anniversary,

164
00:08:32,137 --> 00:08:33,460
Sharon left him.

165
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:37,958
She had decided to move to the West Coast to be closer to her children,

166
00:08:37,982 --> 00:08:40,431
and she didn't want a long-distance relationship.

167
00:08:41,224 --> 00:08:45,987
Miguel was totally blindsided and utterly devastated.

168
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,425
He barely functioned at work for many, many months,

169
00:08:49,449 --> 00:08:51,945
and he almost lost his job as a result.

170
00:08:52,624 --> 00:08:56,439
Another consequence of heartbreak is that feeling alone and in pain

171
00:08:56,463 --> 00:08:59,518
can significantly impair our intellectual functioning,

172
00:08:59,542 --> 00:09:04,314
especially when performing complex tasks involving logic and reasoning.

173
00:09:04,338 --> 00:09:06,650
It temporarily lowers our IQ.

174
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:11,562
But it wasn't just the intensity of Miguel's grief

175
00:09:11,586 --> 00:09:13,481
that confused his employers;

176
00:09:13,505 --> 00:09:14,965
it was the duration.

177
00:09:15,806 --> 00:09:18,086
Miguel was confused by this as well

178
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,866
and really quite embarrassed by it.

179
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:22,936
"What's wrong with me?" he asked me in our session.

180
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,922
"What adult spends almost a year getting over a one-year relationship?"

181
00:09:27,624 --> 00:09:29,849
Actually, many do.

182
00:09:30,873 --> 00:09:35,361
Heartbreak shares all the hallmarks of traditional loss and grief:

183
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:38,332
insomnia, intrusive thoughts,

184
00:09:38,356 --> 00:09:40,309
immune system dysfunction.

185
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:44,362
Forty percent of people experience clinically measurable depression.

186
00:09:45,522 --> 00:09:48,852
Heartbreak is a complex psychological injury.

187
00:09:48,876 --> 00:09:51,517
It impacts us in a multitude of ways.

188
00:09:51,994 --> 00:09:54,693
For example, Sharon was both very social

189
00:09:55,225 --> 00:09:56,607
and very active.

190
00:09:56,631 --> 00:09:59,221
She had dinners at the house every week.

191
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:02,264
She and Miguel went on camping trips with other couples.

192
00:10:02,288 --> 00:10:04,181
Although Miguel was not religious,

193
00:10:04,205 --> 00:10:06,383
he accompanied Sharon to church every Sunday,

194
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:08,694
where he was welcomed into the congregation.

195
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:11,611
Miguel didn't just lose his girlfriend;

196
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,821
he lost his entire social life,

197
00:10:14,845 --> 00:10:17,283
the supportive community of Sharon's church.

198
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:19,437
He lost his identity as a couple.

199
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:24,541
Now, Miguel recognized the breakup had left this huge void in his life,

200
00:10:24,565 --> 00:10:27,326
but what he failed to recognize

201
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,727
is that it left far more than just one.

202
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,800
And that is crucial,

203
00:10:32,311 --> 00:10:37,296
not just because it explains why heartbreak could be so devastating,

204
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,475
but because it tells us how to heal.

205
00:10:40,754 --> 00:10:42,899
To fix your broken heart,

206
00:10:42,923 --> 00:10:46,782
you have to identify these voids in your life and fill them,

207
00:10:46,806 --> 00:10:48,383
and I mean all of them.

208
00:10:48,407 --> 00:10:50,136
The voids in your identity:

209
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,808
you have to reestablish who you are and what your life is about.

210
00:10:53,832 --> 00:10:55,544
The voids in your social life,

211
00:10:55,568 --> 00:10:58,644
the missing activities, even the empty spaces on the wall

212
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,258
where pictures used to hang.

213
00:11:01,159 --> 00:11:02,955
But none of that will do any good

214
00:11:02,979 --> 00:11:06,226
unless you prevent the mistakes that can set you back,

215
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:09,226
the unnecessary searches for explanations,

216
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:13,457
idealizing your ex instead of focusing on how they were wrong for you,

217
00:11:13,481 --> 00:11:17,302
indulging thoughts and behaviors that still give them a starring role

218
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:18,937
in this next chapter of your life

219
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:20,503
when they shouldn't be an extra.

220
00:11:22,368 --> 00:11:24,687
Getting over heartbreak is hard,

221
00:11:24,711 --> 00:11:29,175
but if you refuse to be misled by your mind and you take steps to heal,

222
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,874
you can significantly minimize your suffering.

223
00:11:31,898 --> 00:11:34,318
And it won't just be you who benefit from that.

224
00:11:34,342 --> 00:11:36,397
You'll be more present with your friends,

225
00:11:36,421 --> 00:11:38,635
more engaged with your family,

226
00:11:39,056 --> 00:11:42,859
not to mention the billions of dollars of compromised productivity

227
00:11:42,883 --> 00:11:44,976
in the workplace that could be avoided.

228
00:11:46,271 --> 00:11:48,561
So if you know someone who is heartbroken,

229
00:11:49,093 --> 00:11:50,652
have compassion,

230
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:54,426
because social support has been found to be important for their recovery.

231
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:56,371
And have patience,

232
00:11:56,902 --> 00:12:00,632
because it's going to take them longer to move on than you think it should.

233
00:12:01,466 --> 00:12:02,694
And if you're hurting,

234
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:04,735
know this:

235
00:12:05,155 --> 00:12:08,245
it's difficult, it is a battle within your own mind,

236
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:10,469
and you have to be diligent to win.

237
00:12:10,493 --> 00:12:12,298
But you do have weapons.

238
00:12:12,322 --> 00:12:13,592
You can fight.

239
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,676
And you will heal.

240
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:17,640
Thank you.

241
00:12:17,664 --> 00:12:21,581
(Applause)
